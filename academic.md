My academic research focuses on how we make collective decisions with and about emerging digital technologies. I am especially interested in the role of economic expertise in these decisions. Methodologically, I blend perspectives from statistics, economics, and science & technology studies (STS).

<summary><em>Abstract</em></summary>

<!-- This study develops and experimentally tests an AI-based mediation tool designed to facilitate constructive online dialogue across political divides. Powered by a large language model (LLM), the tool automates mediation interventions grounded in communication and conflict resolution principles such as paraphrasing, identifying agreement, and encouraging perspective-taking. In a randomized controlled trial, the system successfully generated context-sensitive interventions in contentious conversations; however, effects on participants' attitudes towards people they disagree with were limited. The findings highlight both the promise and the challenges of using LLMs to promote healthier online discourse at scale.  -->

Forthcoming.

### <strong>*Leaving Money on the Dashboard: Price Dispersion and Search Frictions on Uber and Lyft*</strong>
This project is a collaboration with Michael Luca and Yejia (Richard) Xu. A current draft is available [on NBER](https://www.nber.org/papers/w34441).

<summary><em>Abstract</em></summary>

We document price differences for identical trips on Uber and Lyft, based on an audit of the two platforms. While price dispersion exists in the market, device-level data show that only 16.1 percent of consumers opening one app also open the other. Our estimates suggest that the modest frictions involved in comparison shopping increase platforms’ gross booking volume by over $300 million annually in New York City alone. While price-comparison engines could in principle reduce frictions, Uber’s API terms of use limit such services, reducing riders’ ability to price compare.

### <strong>*Perfomativity, Complexity & Framing in the FCC Incentive Auction*</strong>

This project is a work in progress. It was presented at Harvard's [STS Circle](https://www.wcfia.harvard.edu/event/science-technology-and-society-seminar-sts-circle-02-24-25) and [GRiSTS](https://sts.hks.harvard.edu/events/workshops/grists-2024/) in 2024.

<summary><em>Abstract</em></summary>

<p> In this paper, I study the Federal Communication Commission’s 2016 Spectrum Incentive Auction, which was developed in collaboration with academic market design economists to reallocate spectrum broadcasting rights from local cable television broadcasters to mobile broadband providers. The paper will proceed in three parts. First, I will analyze the Incentive Auction from the perspective of the performativity of economics (e.g. Mitchell 2007; MacKenzie 2008), focusing especially on the work of ``framing” (Callon 1998)--that is, the work of delineating the economic objects, agents, and decisions that would be ``on stage” and hence relevant in auction transactions. I will show that none of this framing was accomplished ``for free”, but instead required various background legal, political, and material investments to hold in place. Second, I will zoom out and examine the design flexibility of the auction as whole. Of the many ways that the public problem of spectrum reallocation might have been addressed , how and why was the Incentive Auction understood as a necessary, appropriate, and ultimately successful solution? In addressing this question, I will focus especially on the role of ``complexity” in rendering the auction, its particular form, and expert intervention more broadly, as necessary. I will argue that rendering the problem ``complex” is a co-productive move (Jasanoff 2004): it involves both (1) making a fact about the economic reality, and (2) drawing a normative implication about the need for particular sorts of economic expertise in helping to manage it. In the third and final part of the paper, I will consider the auction’s success, exploring how it was rendered successful despite evidence of overflowing (Callon 1998) in the form of strategic manipulation by private equity firms and multi-station owners (Doraszelski et al. 2017). </p>
