I felt a bit tired today, maybe from my longer ride yesterday. I did wet feet again. I almost have it all memorized now, though I get a little confused in the Belmont suburb-y part. Sharpe and School street are now in memory though. 

The trails were a bit wet from storms this morning, which I didn't think of; but the ride was all good. I stoped for a while and watched a competitive mens league soccer match which I could hear happening from the trail.

I listened to some Quadeca on the Minuteman on the way back. An unusual genre mix! Interested to explore him more.
