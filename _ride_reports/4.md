I tried out [light northern dirt](https://www.urbandirt.org/routes/light-northern-dirt) from urbandirt. I enjoyed it a fair bit overall. I especially loved the parts that go through Middlesex fells, breakneck reservation, and Lynn woods. The Fells especially is really quite beautiful, and it's amazing that it is so close. There are indeed a few tricky/rocky bits on this route, but they are manageable, and well worth it. Maybe I'll go for a swim at Breakneck next time I do this route. The chill ride back on the northern strand trail is a nice way to end things. 

The only annoying part of this route was few bits between Middlesex and Breakneck where the route takes you through some trails that were tough to follow. It's nice to be on trails, but I'd rather just do roads for these bits I think, since the reservations are the really nice bits. 

Anyhow, the weather was quite nice and I felt good today.
