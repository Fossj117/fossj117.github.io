Today was one of those days where it felt like there were things to do, but it wasn't clear quite what. Either I should "be productive" or take advantage of the time to decompress effectively. Sometimes it's hard to decide. Also, I was feeling sleep, low-energy. Maybe not enough caffeine, or food or something. But I decided to go ahead and try to get out for a ride and did the classic [Wet Feet](https://www.urbandirt.org/routes/wet-feet). 

I felt pretty weak for the first chunk of it, and struggled up the hill. I think I hadn't eaten enough today (just my Formaggio BBQ brunch earlier in the day). I stopped at the market and grabbed some sugar and more water which helped me feel a bit better. 

I stopped and sat in the meadow a while and listened to the sounds and tried to just de-compress. Here's a pic and some sounds.

On the way home, the sun was getting low and it was nice. I listened to the new Dijon album and stopped at Spy Pond for a while.
