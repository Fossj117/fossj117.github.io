Chill coffee outside ride this morning with M. and A. Met down at Magazine Beach, drank some coffee and ate a few pastries. We discussed local cycling infrastructure and cafe preferences, then rode out for a causal ride. We rode west along the river, continuing on the dirt paths by Watertown, eventually circling back along the other side of the river back to Harvard square. We talked about sewing and Burning Man and the nature of grief.
