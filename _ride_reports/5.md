I did a quick evening run of wet feet. I've almost learned it, but had to check the route a few times. Being able to go for a nice ride starting at 6pm is my favorite thing about the summer. I'm getting comfier on the single track, and felt nice and flowy through the good parts. I didn't have to dismount on any of the annoying rocky bits. I am thinking more and more that maybe a mountain bike of some sort will be my next bike purchase. It's so nice to be on the trails away from cars and often people in general.
