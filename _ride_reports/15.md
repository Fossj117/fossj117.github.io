I was feeling lazy this afternoon after getting out earlier in the day for the rat race and other things. I watched soccer and napped, and debated whether to go out this evening. 

In the end I decided to go for it, mainly motivated by the hope of seeing the sunflower fields at peak bloom out on the farms near the Battle Road. I left late in the day, expecting darkness on the ways back, but was glad to get out. It was fairly quiet on the trails. 

Out at the sunflower fields, it turned out to my surprise that the flowers had all been harvested! There was a kind of melancholy in that for me, especially seeing the remnant bits strewn around the empty field. It felt apt to be there right around sunset and I took some nice photos:

As it turns out, one of the other fields nearby was still yet to be harvested.

On the way back, I thought about the wildflowers in contrast. M told me that this species (purple loosestrife) is pretty but "invasive":

Invasive is a strange environmental word, loaded with agency and normativity. The sunflowers, deliberately cultivated in some space that was once something else are not "invasive". They are planned, intentional, deliberate. But the loosestrife is a wild invader. 

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lythrum_salicaria#As_an_invasive_species) tells me the following about the loosestrife as invasive: 

> Purple-loosestrife has been introduced into temperate New Zealand and North America where it is now widely naturalised (spreading on its own) and officially listed in some controlling agents. Infestations may rarely result in dramatic disruption in water flow in rivers and canals, and the life cycles of organisms from waterfowl to amphibians to algae being affected

However...

> ...research about how invasive plants are portrayed in media indicate that the threat from loosestrife and other infamous invasive plants is driven more by media attention than science. While the species does have negative impacts on the natural environment the scientific literature supports a much more modest assessment of how bad it is outside its native range and that resources would be better spent on preventing disturbance of wetlands than on the removal of purple-loosestrife

In [this other document](https://www.mass.gov/doc/purple-loosestrife-0/download) about the plant in MA, it is described as "a hardy, aggressive, non-native wetland invader" which is pretty wild. In any case, it seems that the concern about the plant is that it can grow and spread pretty rapidly, displacing native species, choking off waterways, and ultimately reducing biodiversity.
