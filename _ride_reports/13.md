Lovely afternoon ride with new buddy, R. I'd run into R a few times around town, acknowledging mutual taste in bike things. Today, saw him at the cafe earlier in the day and he came out to check out the Bombora. We made plans to ride in the afternoon and met up later on. We sat around for a bit and talked bike things; I checked out R's other builds and his upcoming road build. We unboxed a nice Paul stem. He told me a story about his connection to my frame. 

Then we rode out on a loop he likes, from Somerville out to Medford and into the Fells. It was a lovely day, sunny. We talked about stealth camping spots. We came back along the mystic lakes I think, where there are lots of dirt paths as well. It was fun to ride with a new pal who is on a similar bike wavelength.
