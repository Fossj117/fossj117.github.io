I learned from my past experiences and committed early to having a "no work" day today. Deciding early on makes the day more restful -- removes any wondering about when/whether I'll find a time to "be productive". Engaging more with [the Maintainers](https://themaintainers.org/) has been helpful for me in clarifying the idea that a really restful or grounding day is a day of maintenance, not a day of blobbing or doing absolutely nothing. Instead, a day of focusing on the things that are really important to me. Maintenance, repair of the self, the soul. And so, today was a good day of maintenace; some laundry, some cleaning, some sitting outside at the cafe, some soccer-watching, and a nice long bike ride.

I set out around 1 after doing a quick bike clean. It was unseasonably warm -- a nice chance to enjoy the autumn colors. What I noticed the most were the yellow-greens, the dominant palettte. Is it true that the yellows come first, then the oranges and the reds?

I love the variations in color in the trees even more than the colors themselves, amplified when the light catches some branches and not others. Even without the autumn colors, there's something lovely about a lighter yellow-green, caught in the sun, set against darker greens and browns behind. It's a nice point of creative inspiration.

I rode out on my usual route towards Lexington and Concord. It wasn't too crowded, but there were some folks around. I rode past a turkey on the Minuteman around Lexington; I see them often in the city, but not around there much.

Beyond Lexington, the dirt paths were really lovely.

In Concord, I decided to take a diversion over to Walden and sat for a while by the pond. I started *Middlesex* again, which happened to be on my Kindle. 

The ride back on the Battle Road trail was nice as well. So many nice autumnal views. I do find something fun about a tree that's decided to commit early to the changing of colors and even dropping leaves, creating its own little pocket of color against the steadfast greens.

I thought about the poem *Hyla Brook* by Robert Frost and tried to see how much of it I recall from memory. I remember the beginning and the end, but the middle was muddled. I looked it up and tried to solidfy the rest. A current effort: 

<pre>
> By June, our brook's run out of song and speed, 
> Sought for much after that it will be found
> Either to have gone groping underground
> (And taken with it all the Hyla breed, 
> that shouted in the mist a month ago, 
> like ghosts of sleigh bells in a ghost of snow)
> Or flourished and come up in jewel-weed, 
> Weak foliage that's blown upon and bent, 
> even against the way its waters went. 
> Its bed is left a faded paper sheet
> Of dead leaves stuck together by the heat. 
> A brook to none but who remember long. 
> This as it will be seen is other far, 
> From brooks taken otherwhere in song. 
> We love the things we love for what they are. 
</pre>

Remembering only certain parts of poems is meaningful in its own right -- the snippets that resonate and echo around in the mind. 

In the sunflower fields, I watched a gathering of geese.
