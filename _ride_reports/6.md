Another chill evening ride. Felt a bit slow on the way out; also drivetrain was making some squeaks because I didn't clean after last ride. I like most when it feels super quiet and smooth. I rode out to the Arlington Great Meadow, and rode around aimlessly on the different paths. I'm getting to know the paths a bit better; the whole area is not too big, and the paths are all connected, so you can kinda just go wherever. I do feel more confident and experienced riding trails. 

I drafted someone most of the way back on the Minuteman trail who was going pretty quick. I'm always curious about the etiquitte of drafting in casual settings like that; should I have offered to take the lead for a bit? It's fun either way, these transient partnerships. We ride together for these couple miles, then he turns off some direction I'm not going; no words exchanged throughout, but a bit of collaboration.
