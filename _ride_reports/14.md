I rode around in the [Allston rat race](https://www.commonwheels.org/save-the-date-2025) this morning, an alleycat-style "race that's not a race". My first time doing it, and I didn't know much what was going on for a while. I wasn't sure what to look for with the checkpoints, and had trouble finding the first. Turns out is was balloons and hole punches. I figured it out after fumbling around the first lap, and did a second lap for good measure which was smoother. I suppose I could have done more maybe, but my main intention was to support Common Wheels (a nice local bike org) and check out what the scene was like. It was fun to see and connect with some of the other folks who came out for the ride. I popped straight over to the Formaggio barbecue after the ride, a weekend mainstay, and then home to watch some soccer.
