I rode the opening of [Wet Feet](https://www.urbandirt.org/routes/wet-feet) for the first time into my normal Lexington / Concord loop that starts in Lexington. 

Overall, the addition of wet feet was really fun, and I will ride it more. Some more single track type stuff, but ultimately very rideable and fun. 

I am really not very experienced with that kind of riding, but I'm learning and getting better. Headphones out and sunglasses off was the way today; let the flow come from engaging with the ride. 

Anyhow -- well constructed route, going through lots of little paths that you'd have to know to know. It will be fun to explore more around beaver brook.
