After an early morning cafe stop, I rode out for my personal variant of "light northern gravel". I thought about the notion of "performativity" and how it's changed, and also thought about LLM's, progeny, and provenance. I tried to speak something about these themes while resting in the Fells, but continued on. It was a beautiful day, not overly hot. Sunny. I stopped again in Breakheart by the water. There was no swimming today, so it was quiet. On the way back from Lynn, I listened to Ceremony, recommended by J. I resepect the way their sound has changed. The synthy electronic bits on Into the Spirit World Now felt the most novel and interesting. I thought about the incoherence of "good taste" and how toxic and judgmental it inevitably becomes. Better to focus on "my taste".
