S and I met up at the art museum. We talked about anger, performativity, trees, anarchism, difficulties with the academic life. I got a prickly pear lemonade at the cafe which was <span style="color:rgb(230, 29, 130);">far pinker</span> than I anticipated; S tried a matcha but was unimpressed.

We walked and then biked down by the river with Memorial drive closed. We talked more about masculinity, desire, grief and loss. We looped around and did the root-y little dirt section by the river and then circled back to the other side.

Near the exercise park, we watched the geese for a while. They were calm and polite. It started to rain, and so we took shelter under a big tree nearby. The rain was a welcome cooling off, and it was nice to connect with the tree that covered us. We took a few photographs, maybe future tree portraits.

The afternoon felt connective and expansive. I felt grateful for the time, and hopeful for S and her path through it all.

On the way back, we stopped at Trader Joes. I saw my sunflowers cut and ready for sale.
