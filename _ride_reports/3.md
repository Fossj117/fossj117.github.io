I took a pass at combining wet feet and my usual lexinton / concord gravel route via the battle road. It worked out well and is a good loop. It's kinda similar to [reformed paul](https://www.urbandirt.org/routes/reformed-paul) on UD, but a little different. I took a jump over to Walden which was nice on a Friday afternoon, and sat in the water a while. Somehow I got a lot of sand in my shorts.
