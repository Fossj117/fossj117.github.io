Been feeling agitated this week, which is probably related to not riding my bike (in one causal direction or another). It's easy for me to fall into these scarcity mindset vibes some of the time -- I don't have time to XYZ etc. 

But anyhow, I chose to cut out around 3 or 4 today, to go off for a chill ride. I just wanted to get out and get moving. I did my standard Lexington / Concord / Battle road loop, which is pretty relaxed. 

Weather was nice for it and the trails were fairly clear of people. I stopped in Lexington for a snack. On the battle road trail, I noticed that some of the surrounding fields seem to be just large fields of sunflowers. I guess I had tacitly assumed they were some sort of more "functional" planting. But now a few are starting to flower. 

I will have to do this route a few more times in the next few weeks to see if I can catch them in full bloom. Seems like it will be A LOT of sunflowers!

On the ride back, I listened to my soccer podcast. Turns out that it has been an interesting transfer window. I'm excited for the season to start again. I love the wholesomeness of watching soccer on the weekend mornings. 

Anyhow, after riding, I felt better.
