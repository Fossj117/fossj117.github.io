Took the commuter rail with my bike for the first time, out to Newburyport. It was an easy ride to North Station and then a direct shot out, a bit over an hour. There weren't many people on the train going that way at that time, so having my bike was a non-issue. Seems like there is plenty of space in general. 

Newburyport has some decent bike infra, including a nice trail that runs from the train station into town. We explored some cafes and a giant barnful of vintage oddities, then rode down to the beach, which was a few miles. There was some kind of meetup of RC plane enthusiasts, so I watched them doing some fancy flips and twists of their planes, only later realizing it was RC. We rode past what I learned is a "salt marsh"; something like a meadow that is tidally water-logged. 

The beach was nice; plenty of space but also a decent showing for a mid Friday afternoon. Someone was kite boarding and I dug a hole which accidentally exposed a little beach crab.

I was off schedule on the train-ride home; and so I spent a while exploring the local brewery off the bike path. I lied on the bench at the train platform. It was sunny and warm. 

The train ride back was easy as well, and I rode over the bridge back to Cambridge at sunset.
