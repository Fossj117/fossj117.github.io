It's been getting cooler out and I have been getting busier and so I haven't had as much time to ride. So when C messaged me this afternoon to go out for a bike jaunt, it was a welcome nudge. 

We'd talked a while ago about the cycling philosophy of riding without a pre-defined route, and so we proceeded on that approach. The general idea was to start in Harvard Square and make our way toward Beaver Brook. 

We started at JFK park and followed the river West a while, then heading into Belmont. At Sofra, we turned right on the bike path toward Fresh Pond. I told C about the Cuddy Cap I'd found on the path a while back. 

At the pond we did the usual loop, exploring some of the side paths here and there. At Black's Nook we saw a frog and discussed what it's like to return to the same place at different times.

We continued on into Belmont on a route I don't know too well. I haven't ridden around Belmont too much aside a few specific routes, I realized. Eventually we made it to the train tracks that I'm used to crossing when heading to Beaver Brook, albeit further West than where I typically cross. 

We went by some large construction, but eventually made it into Beaver Brook after a bit more exploration. After some uncertainty, it's always fun to arrive in a place that's finally familiar.

The sun was getting lower, but we rode around the reservation a bit. I saw a fox run across the path on the way in, low to the ground, moving quickly. My second fox encounter this season. We also watched a family of deer a while, making eye contact with the buck who watched us back.

Eventually, we rode home down the hill and through Belmont.
