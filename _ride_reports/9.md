Did my first coffee outside ride this morning; went down the river to watertown and back by path to fresh pond. We grabbed second coffees and then barbeque when it opened. We talked about cider, creative projects, bike things, generative AI. 

Later in the day I decided to take on "[stony blues](https://www.urbandirt.org/routes/stony-blues)" from Urban Dirt which turned out to be an adventure. In the first place, it was through paths and places I've never been through. But also, many of the paths turned out to be quite overgrown and seemingly rarely-used. That creates a really different sort of energy to things -- like I was in the middle of nowhere somewhere, just putting my trust in this urban dirt route to chart a way home.

It's funny, these sites that give you access to this local knowledge -- you will be riding down a road and suddenly get routed directly into what seems to be a solid forest; seemingly there is nowhere to go. And yet, somehow, there will indeed be a path there which you would almost certainly never have noticed, much less trusted it would take you somewhere reasonable.

This ride was heavy on that energy.

The middle part of the ride is out of the way; it would be good to bring more nutrition next time, since there's not many spots to stop.

New spots that could be nice to revisit: 

* Arnold arboretum. I'd never been here; but it was quite an easy ride to get there. I'll definitely be back and explore more. 
* Houghton pond was a nice spot to emerge onto. 
* The ride back along the coast was nice, though some parts congested with tourists and folks outside; the area around Pleasure bay and Castle island was particularly nice. 

The arboretum and castle island area are spots I've meant to visit, but never made it to.
