It took me a while to post this ride. I've been feeling a bit unsettled, worried about work things and such; trying to finish things. Not enough separation I guess. 

Anyhow, Sunday was one of those boundary days that I hadn't quite clarified: is this a day for work or for rest. And so I progressed on the unsettled boundary with the possibility of productivity hanging over things. Later in the day, I decided I ought to just go out for a ride. It's never a bad idea. 

What I remember of the ride most is that it's beginning to be autumn in the forest. In a few spots, leaves had fallen, covering up the trail, and obscuring rocks and roots. A bit tricky. Elsewhere, the hints of contrast between red and green. Just hints.

I also took a pic of this recognizable spot in Beaver Brook; I guess there was some kind of smudge on my lens, giving an interesting sort of effect:
