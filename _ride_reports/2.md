I set out later in the day after watching the Club World Cup final, and rode [Wet Feet](https://www.urbandirt.org/routes/wet-feet) again, this time without any additions. It's a fun little route. 

Getting more comfortable in the chunkier single track bits. Carrying momentum more and paying attention. Interesting skill, reading the trail ahead and trying to choose a reasonable line in the moment. 

Listened to Dan Deacon on the way back. I'll listen more. I started with one of his older albums which reminded me of Animal Collective from that era. 

My thing now is that I listen to albums straight through when I'm riding on simple, familiar terrain. On the single track bits I take my headphones out and my sunglasses off.
