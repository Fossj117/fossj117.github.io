It was a day with many possibilities, and I was not quite sure which direction I'd move. 

But I went out for a later afternoon ride, before some dinner plans in the evening. 

My bike was due for some clean-up, and so I took that on earlier, with a full tub cleaning -- spraying things down, scrubbing, rinsing and such. 

The bike felt really nice to ride after, as it always does; the drivetrain maintenance especially -- but also the visual and emotional feel of a clean bike is something. I also gave some more air to the tires up to round 35 psi. They'd been low, especially for road riding, and the difference is definitely easy to feel -- just more smooth and efficienty power transfer which is enjoyable. 

I did a standard ride up the Minuteman trail towards Lexington, without much plan. I turned off in the Great Meadow. 

The leaves are starting to change, but are still early. Here and there there are leaves on path, bits of red and yellow and rusty brown among the greens -- the early movers -- though also mixed with late-blooming flowers of other colors: bright yellows, purples.

I wondered whether these yellow flowers are natural or "invasive", neutral or oppressive. 

I eventually continued on to Lexington. I'd considered trying to do the whole Concord loop, but it didn't seem worth rushing. I ride mostly to feel more grounded and connected with myself and the place.

Along the way to Lexington, there were at least three separate lemonade stands, staffed by children of varying ages. I realized too late, but at least a few of them take Venmo now, it seems. The lack of folks carrying cash would seem to be a challenge for the contemporary lemonade stand. 

In Lexington, I got a snack and sat in the park a while. Some kids rode up on bikes to a tree nearby, with plans to climb; "this is the one", the leader boy said, and moved quickly up the branches. He'd done this before. The second boy had a bit more difficulty with the climb, and the two did a little dance of masculinity micro-hierarchy; who leads and who follows, who can do it and who cannot, who is capable, who needs help, and so on. In the end, the leader boy was kind, and he lent a hand to pull the second boy up, and they climbed together.

On the way back I stopped in the Meadow again, and rode by one of my favorite spots. There was another fellow a ways off, with bike and hammock, relaxing in the clearing. I thought that was a nice idea, and that maybe I should get a hammock too, to encourage even more stopping and resting.
