Felt like I am getting sick, but wanted to get outside for at least a bit. Rode in jeans and a flannel and went very slow up the Minuteman, hoping to make it to the Arlington Great Meadow. It felt further than normal, but I made it there eventually and turned in. Many nice autumn colors and a gathering of ducks on the ride up.

In the meadow, I saw that the wildflowers are all gone now, just withered brown stems now. Their colors are replaced by autumn leaves. There's a spiritual sense to an autumn tree caught in a sun beam; like it's been highlighted by god for a moment. The photo hardly captures it.

I sat for a long while in my usual clearing. My body was craving to sit and do nothing.

I watched squirrels chase each other across the space, and wondered about the brownish moss. Wandering around the space a while, I came across a funny bit of art I'd never seen before.

Heading out, this tree captured my attention with its lichen and contrasting leafy vine. Maybe a future portrait.
