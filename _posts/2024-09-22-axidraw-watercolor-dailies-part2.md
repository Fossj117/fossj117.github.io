## Introduction

It is Sunday again, and this week I want to restart my practice of pen plotter and watercolor dailies. I took a week off from doing these in any formalized way, and felt worse for it. There is something quite nice and grounding about having a daily creative practice, and the commitment that is involved in this. Focusing and iterating on one theme is also a nice way to refine my sense of my own creative "taste": do I like this more or less than my last attempt? How might I build on the directions of exploration that I *do* find appealing? 

So this week, I will return to my daily pen plotter and watercolor practice. I am still allowing myself to experiment with different variations of this process. Some directions I am interested in: 

* More layering and depth. Trading between plotting and painting in the process. 
* More contrast and variation in color. Can i be more bold in my application of pigment? 
* Different drawing tools. I have a few ideas to experiment with here. 
* New algorithmic designs. I am not too inspired by the simple grid of squares I have been working with so far. I have a few other directions in mind. 

A few longer term directions I am interested in as well: 

* How might I develop this process into something that I can do *without* needing to be on my laptop. I am inspired by the idea of single-purpose devices, and the analogy of "DAW-less" setups in music production. This would build also on our interactive plotting exhibit at OpenSauce. 
* Combination with MCMC drawing process. Putting ink and colors in roughly the right place; using the water to allow them to bleed, but retain something representational in the end. 

Anyway, now on to the dailies. 

## Day 1 (Sunday)

Today I wound up doing a whole mix of experiments.

Some new elements: 

* More layering and contrast. I tried separating out different layers of the machine drawing, and adding bits of watercolor in between. 
* I tried taking the ink out of the pen in several of these, just filling the cartridge with water, and using the ink and pigment on the page to create marks. 
* I tried using the fountain pen ink directly for painting in some of these, sometimes mixed with bits of watercolor. 
* In one of these, I did another layer on top using a white pencil. 

Lots of interesting developments here. Generally I like how the process goes with little ink in the pen, and I like more layering and interaction. For now, I am converging for now on a palette involving the black ink with blue/green undertones, as well as blue and some orange.
