## Introduction

It is Sunday again, and this week I want to restart my practice of pen plotter and watercolor dailies. I took a week off from doing these in any formalized way, and felt worse for it. There is something quite nice and grounding about having a daily creative practice, and the commitment that is involved in this. Focusing and iterating on one theme is also a nice way to refine my sense of my own creative "taste": do I like this more or less than my last attempt? How might I build on the directions of exploration that I *do* find appealing? 

So this week, I will return to my daily pen plotter and watercolor practice. I am still allowing myself to experiment with different variations of this process. Some directions I am interested in: 

* More layering and depth. Trading between plotting and painting in the process. 
* More contrast and variation in color. Can i be more bold in my application of pigment? 
* Different drawing tools. I have a few ideas to experiment with here. 
* New algorithmic designs. I am not too inspired by the simple grid of squares I have been working with so far. I have a few other directions in mind. 

A few longer term directions I am interested in as well: 

* How might I develop this process into something that I can do *without* needing to be on my laptop. I am inspired by the idea of single-purpose devices, and the analogy of "DAW-less" setups in music production. This would build also on our interactive plotting exhibit at OpenSauce. 
* Combination with MCMC drawing process. Putting ink and colors in roughly the right place; using the water to allow them to bleed, but retain something representational in the end. 

Anyway, now on to the dailies. 

## Day 1 (Sunday)

Today I wound up doing a whole mix of experiments.

Some new elements: 

* More layering and contrast. I tried separating out different layers of the machine drawing, and adding bits of watercolor in between. 
* I tried taking the ink out of the pen in several of these, just filling the cartridge with water, and using the ink and pigment on the page to create marks. 
* I tried using the fountain pen ink directly for painting in some of these, sometimes mixed with bits of watercolor. 
* In one of these, I did another layer on top using a white pencil. 

Lots of interesting developments here. Generally I like how the process goes with little ink in the pen, and I like more layering and interaction. For now, I am converging for now on a palette involving the black ink with blue/green undertones, as well as blue and some orange. 

Some closer photos of variants I like:

On the left above here is ~no ink into pure watercolor. This next one is layering with ink and white pencil on top (no ink in the pen):

Something that this process has me thinking a lot about is contrast and "depth". A lot of generative art and pen plotted work (including most of my own) is quite "flat", visually-speaking. There's nothing wrong with a visual work being flat; however, I am interested in exploring alternatives. In the pen plotting world, I do see a fair amount of "layering" of colors on the page -- e.g. CMYK work; however, it often seems to be about creating particular hues through mixing, rather than trying to create depth and contrast in the work. In this process, I am intersted in exploring the use of layering more to create contrast and depth. The final drawing above is the most successful experiment in this direction so far, but I think there's a lot more to explore here. 

Separately, tomorrow I think I will try creating a clean edge on the pieces, and tidy things up a bit. Stuff like that can sometimes make a surprisingly big difference in the overall feel. 

## Day 2 (Monday)

Today I am making a few small tweaks on the algorithmic side, pushing for a slightly denser look, and splitting out the design into three separate layers for plotting. Here is the result: 

<img src="/figs/2024-09-06-axidraw-watercolor-dailies/day9.jpg" alt="Image 2">

Here, I started with an initial layer mixing ink and watercolor and plotted into that with the inkless fountain pen. Then I added another layer of ink and watercolor and plotted again with the pen. After letting this dry, I did a final plotted layer with white pencil. 

At first, I felt that this sketch was a bit busy, but it's grown on me a bit as I look at it more. In general, I like the texture of the pencil layer on top of the ink and want to experiment with more of that, maybe in different ways. I may also be close to ready to try a bigger sketch tomorrow, or at least some variants to the algorithm that could introduce more variation in scale and perhaps shape. 

I also made a Tik Tok video today reflecting some more on my recent iterations on this process and thinking about "depth" and contrast in pen-plotted work. Check it out here:

Something that I am thinking about today is how this process of doing daily creative work implicitly encourages me to reflect and be more mindful of the work I am doing, which is good. After each iteration, it's natural to think about what I like or don't like about it, and what I could try differently next time. This is a benefit in addition to the feeling of groundedness and commitment that comes with regular practice. 

## Day 3 (Tuesday)

In today's experiment, I used some new watercolor paper that I picked up yesterday, and consequently changed the aspect ratio of the piece. I did a first layer of diluted ink with, but left it somewhat less damp than some prior tests. I also filled the fountain pen more completely with water. In the first plotter layer this had some interesting effects, as it actually lightened some areas it passed over. I then did a layer with the white pencil. After that, I thought the piece might be done, but was conflicted. I also wanted the depth that comes with more layering, and was concerned that maybe it was just fear of ruining something nice that was holding me back from going in again. I decided to be brave and go ahead with it, and added some more ink and did another layer with the plotter. It came out okay. I am not sure I like doing anything on top of the white pencil, it seems to just mush it around without much interest. I think in the future I will leave pencil layers for the end mainly. In general, I think that more layering is still the way as far as continuing to develop this process. In addition to the results, I enjoy the process of the layering, trading back and forth between me and the machine; active and reactive -- co-charting the course. Here is the result:

*She said the days were getting shorter*

</div>

In the end, I think that I like this one quite a bit. I finally figured out a nice setup to get a fairly clean edge and also have good alignment with the plotter. I do think more layering will be nice. But I like not going over the top in terms of the contrast, and blending out the edges of the inked portions more.

Today I am also thinking about how basically all satisfaction in work/creation comes from care and attention. There are no shortcuts. Creative work will be satisfying and meaningful in direct proportion with the amount of care and attention I put into it. 

## Day 4 (Wednesday)

Today feels like a day that's already a bit caught up in other things. I think that today I will try doing a bit of an underpainting in my watercolor piece of the puzzle. Feeling today the beauty and self-acceptance implicit in doing things that are "useless" to the world. Even (especially) when there are so many "useful" things to do. 

I was talking yesterday with Elspeth about this series of work, and she was saying how it's a very process-oriented series. I am thinking today about what that means. One the one hand there's a conceptual dimension to it that I've explored in some of the previous writing and videos I've made as I work on this. There are conceptually interesting things about working in this way, whatever the visual results. 

But I think there's also think there is also an aspect that I find interesting and personally meaningful in terms of how the process invites interactive presence and attention vis a vis the visual results that are emerging. The different variables available here -- how much water, how much ink/pigment, how dry etc. -- can have big impacts on the visual outcomes that are emerging in the piece. As I move to using more layers, I find the back and forth between my interventions and the automated interventions of the machine to be quite interesting. I try to create the environment for the machine's next intervention to be something fruitful, to take the piece in visually-effective dimension, based on my understanding and attention to the piece so far, and the past experiments with this process. I add some ink or some water. But then the machine comes again and does some things that may or may not conform with my hopes and expectations. Perhaps the machine picks up a bit more ink than I expected in some phase of the plotting, and the marks become much darker. Perhaps a part of the paper dries quicker than expected and so winds up empty or faint. There's a lot of uncertainty. And once the intervention is made, it is made, and I have to work with what is next. Of course there are ways to try to erase, or hide things I don't like, but more fruitfully I think the feeling is one of reaction and adaptability: this went in a different direction than I expected, and here we are; what might it need next? How can I create the environment for the next intervention to be successful, given where we are? 

I was thinking about how this is a lot like how I imagine parenting to be; or at least how I think I would approach it. You try to create an environment for your child to succeed, which necessarily involves some assumptions about what "success" means. But then your child intervenes with the way they are, which is both shaped by your decisions and things outside of you. Ideally, as a parent, you mindfully observe and react to these unanticipated interventions, working in collaboration to re-cultivate the environment and co-create some shared version of success. 

Anyway, here is the result for today:

<!-- ## Scripts 

I’ve been working on a new creative process that combines ink, watercolor, and a drawing machine. Stick around to the end if you want to see the results. 

I've been iterating on this process over the last few weeks; most recently, I've been exploring: 

* More layering and contrast. I tried separating out different layers of the machine drawing, and adding bits of watercolor in between. 
* I tried taking the ink out of the pen in several of these, just filling the cartridge with water, and using the ink and pigment on the page to create marks. 
* I tried using the fountain pen ink directly for painting in some of these, sometimes mixed with bits of watercolor. 
* In one of these, I did another layer on top using a white pencil. 

In general, something that this process has me thinking a lot about is value contrast and visual "depth". 

I think that working with a pen plotter, it's quite natural to make work that is visually quite "flat", and relatedly quite limited or dichotomous (or at least discretized) in terms of its use of value (and often color) contrast. 

Like if you're working with a pen or a marker in a single layer, it's like a computer -- you can be "up" or you can be "down" -- on or off, black or white. For example, you can make a drawing like this: 

[Example]

Of course layering different types of mark-making and colors is an option, and is something that my collaborator Evan and I have explored in previous work. For example something like this is made with a CMYK process -- i.e. layering pens of cyan, magenta, yellow and black in different amounts. 

But at least in this piece, the extent of value contrast is still quite limited -- it's mostly about exploring color mixing.

I want to be clear that there's nothing wrong with a visual work being flat or limited in terms of contrast. It's just a visual choice. 

But returning to these watercolor sketches -- part of what I find interesting about the process is that it presents a direction to achieve a more continous range of values, emerging from the varied interaction of the ink and pen. 

And that's an element of the process I want to continue to explore. 

Anyways, thanks for watching. 



But 

There's nothing wrong with a visual work being flat; and in general it makes sense that a lot of pen plotted work is dichotomous in terms of value.
