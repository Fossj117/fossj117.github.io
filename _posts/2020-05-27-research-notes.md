I am experimenting with a new section of this blog that I am calling "research notes". While the "posts" section of the blog is a place for more complete thoughts or projects, the "research notes" section is for incomplete ideas and reflections, especially on research that I am reading or thinking about. 

I am creating this section of the blog as I begin preparing for my PhD qualifying exam. A key part of the qualifying exam is reading and being prepared to write about literature in my areas of interest. As I work through the literature, I am hoping to use this "research notes" space to write, process and reflect on what I am reading. We will see how it goes!
