I picked up an old camera on Facebook marketplace. Here are a few photos from my first roll, taken on walks round Cambridge, mostly during and around a big snowstorm we had. The turkeys, of course, are [a big interest for me](https://jeffreyfossett.com/notes.html#15). I enjoy how boldly they inhabit public spaces around Cambridge that were not designed for them. A snowstorm places a premium on the use of public space for humans and turkeys alike. Sidewalks, parking spaces, bike lanes all must be manually kept clear. The margins are contracted, their inhabitants forced into the core.

For my own future reference, these photos were taken with Kodak Ultramax 400 on my Canon Sure Shot, developed at Hunts, then scanned and touched up in Lightroom. There's lots to learn about all of these steps. The Lightroom tuning was especially new and interesting to me. For a few of these photos I found the adaptive "subject" presets helpful to draw the turkeys away from the background a bit.
