## Introduction

I have continued to enjoy my daily practice working with my pen plotter and watercolor process. I would like to continue the daily practice this week. However, I am starting to feel more unsure of where to go next in terms of further exploring the process I have been working on (at least within the tentative bounds that I've established so far for what the process "is"). 

With that in mind, one option would be to explore a variant that feels like something wholly new and different. I've identified several candidate directions.While this could be fun and motivating, I think I will resist the temptation for at least another week. Part of the goal of this daily experiment has been to explore the groundedness and satisfaction that emerges from sticking with a single idea, and practicing it regularly. So, let's continue working on the current process this week and see what happens. 

## Day 1 (Sunday)

Today I am feeling motivated to do something working with primarily the blue-black ink and perhaps exploring some more varied textural options using the other mark-making tools.I always want more and more layers, so that will be part of the updating. 

Here is today's result:

I did wind up learning some new things. Most interestingly, I did try a few layers where I dipped the fountain pen in isopropyl alcohol. This created an intersting effect on the page, repelling a top layer of pigment near where the marks were being made. This is definitely something I would like to explore further in the future. Additionally, i did a few more layers than I have previously using different colors of the watercolor pencils. These came out okay, though I am not sure they blend as well as I would like. 

Later in the day, I did some more experiments with dipping in alcohol. I think there's a lot more potential to explore this kind of process:

</div>

The latter image here involved tracing shapes with alcohol in a water wash and then placing wet pigment into the wet inside, using the alcohol as a barrier. I think there's a lot more to try with this. 

## Day 2 (Monday)

Today's result:

*there will be time*

Never too sure about these when they come off the board. I worry that these are getting overworked, or are too muddy. Or is that part of the interest of them, all the mixing on the page? Maybe I will try approaching from a different direction tomorrow.
