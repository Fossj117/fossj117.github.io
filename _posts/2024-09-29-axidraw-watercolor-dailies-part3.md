## Introduction

I have continued to enjoy my daily practice working with my pen plotter and watercolor process. I would like to continue the daily practice this week. However, I am starting to feel more unsure of where to go next in terms of further exploring the process I have been working on (at least within the tentative bounds that I've established so far for what the process "is"). 

With that in mind, one option would be to explore a variant that feels like something wholly new and different. I've identified several candidate directions.While this could be fun and motivating, I think I will resist the temptation for at least another week. Part of the goal of this daily experiment has been to explore the groundedness and satisfaction that emerges from sticking with a single idea, and practicing it regularly. So, let's continue working on the current process this week and see what happens. 

## Day 1 (Sunday)

Today I am feeling motivated to do something working with primarily the blue-black ink and perhaps exploring some more varied textural options using the other mark-making tools.I always want more and more layers, so that will be part of the updating. 

Here is today's result:

I did wind up learning some new things. Most interestingly, I did try a few layers where I dipped the fountain pen in isopropyl alcohol. This created an intersting effect on the page, repelling a top layer of pigment near where the marks were being made. This is definitely something I would like to explore further in the future. Additionally, i did a few more layers than I have previously using different colors of the watercolor pencils. These came out okay, though I am not sure they blend as well as I would like. 

Later in the day, I did some more experiments with dipping in alcohol. I think there's a lot more potential to explore this kind of process:

The latter image here involved tracing shapes with alcohol in a water wash and then placing wet pigment into the wet inside, using the alcohol as a barrier. I think there's a lot more to try with this. 

## Day 2 (Monday)

Today's result:

Never too sure about these when they come off the board. I worry that these are getting overworked, or are too muddy. Or is that part of the interest of them, all the mixing on the page? Maybe I will try approaching from a different direction tomorrow. 

## Day 3 (Tuesday)

Today's intentions for the piece are two-fold: 

1. I am drawing on a palette inspired by the flowers [Elspeth](https://thedrip.substack.com/) got me. 
2. Partly related to (1), I will focus mainly on watercolor, and perhaps watercolor pencils, since I don't have much ink that matches this palette well. Something that could be fruitful is exploring watercolor pencils in earlier layers of the mix. I can also explore some different technique variants with these. 

Here is the result:

I am not too psyched on the output today, but it was a good experiment. In general, I think with this palette it's difficult to accomplish some of the features of these pieces that I like. For example, I don't have any ink that really fits in this palette, so I can't really do any machine drawing that bleeds in with the washes. The watercolor pencils can make some nice marks, but also are difficult to blend in this application in the way I would like. I think it would be interesting to explore using these pencils in different ways -- e.g. applying them more densly and then going back in with water to blend them. 

I also found myself wanting a tool for richer mark-making in white, since my white pencil did not make much impact here. I have some pastels to try but I am not set up for them just yet. Maybe something to explore in the future.

In general, I think I didn't feel fully present with the piece today for various reasons and I think that that is part of my dissatisfaction. Satisfcation for me seems to come mainly in line with the extent of my attention, care, and groundedness in doing something. I do think this filters into the work output too, but that's mostly secondary.
