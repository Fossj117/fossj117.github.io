Recently, I've been following along with the [Kendrick / Drake / J Cole beef](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake%E2%80%93Kendrick_Lamar_feud). While there's a lot going on in this drama, one of the more interesting (non-musical) things to come out of it so far is J Cole's apology and choice to bow out of the battle. Cole's statement is a thoughtful reflection on personal growth & decision-making, societal expectations (especially for men), and accountability for mistakes. Here is the full video of Cole's statement:

For context, a few days prior, Cole had released [Might Delete Later](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Might_Delete_Later), which included the diss track [7 Minute Drill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_Minute_Drill), Cole's attack on Kendrick in response to Kendrick's diss in [Like That](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Like_That_(Future,_Metro_Boomin_and_Kendrick_Lamar_song)). 

Cole starts the reflection by discussing his own past and personal spiritual growth. He describes acting out of fear when he was younger, following the world's expectations of him rather than pursuing his own path: 

> I had talent, I had belief in myself, I had motion ... but at the same time, I also had fear. I had fear that maybe I wouldn't get to where I wanted to go. And so that fear had me moving in an unusual way. It had me moving in a way that I was ... thinking about and listening to people's expectations of me and then responding off of that. 

Later, through personal work and spirtual alignment, Cole found healthier and more grounded ways to be in the world -- following his own path rather than external expectations: 

> Luckily I look at the last ten years of my life and I go damn, my life been peaceful, my life been blessed, I been movin' on my own accord, off my own desires, off my own wants

He then transitions to a discussion of [Might Delete Later](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Might_Delete_Later) and his Kendrick diss track, [7 Minute Drill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_Minute_Drill). Cole explains that while he is proud of the mixtape overall, he regrets including the diss track: "that's the lamest shit I ever did in my fuckin life", Cole says. 

He explains that he felt conflicted following Kendrick's diss. On the one hand, he says: 

> I know my heart, right? I know how I feel about ... [Kendrick and Drake, who I've been] blessed to even stand beside in this game, let alone chase, chase their greatness

But on the other hand, he felt that the world (including many people around him) expected him to respond aggressively to Kendrick, to fight back, to go "to war": 

> The world wanna see blood. I dunno if y'all can feel that but the world wanna see blood

In short, Cole knew that he didn't really have any hate or disrespect for Kendrick, but felt the weight of expectations to respond in a certain kind of masculine, aggressive way -- drawing him back into the mindset of his youth: "...all of this time of me movin on my own accord; for the first time I was tested." The strength of these expectations led Cole to put out the diss track, a decision he now regrets: 

> at the end of the day, when I listen to it [7 minute drill], and when it comes out and I see the talk, that shit don't sit right with my spirit, that shit disrupts my fucking peace.

He says that, in reality, he thinks that Kendrick is "one of the greatest motherfuckers to ever touch the microphone", and closes by directly addressing  Kendrick: 

> Bro, that was like the lamest, goofiest shit ... it made me feel like ten years ago when I was moving incorrectly, and I pray that God will align me back up on my own purpose and my path. [...]
> I pray that [Kendrick] didn't feel no way. And if he did, I got my chin out. Take your best shot, I'ma take that shit on the chin, boy. All good. It's love.
> I pray that y'all forgive me for the misstep and I can get back to my true path. I aint gonna lie to y'all, the past two days felt terrible. It let me know how good I been sleeping for the past ten years. 

He then performs "Love Yourz", which is basically a song about love, gratitude, appreciating what you have, and the limits of shallow forms of success (money, fame etc.); he says the song is "a reminder to me of getting back on the right path and getting in tune with God."

I know that some have criticized Cole for his apology on various grounds; for example, [Sowmya Krishnamurthy in Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/j-cole-kendrick-lamar-diss-drake-2024-4) argues that "hip-hop is built on competition" and implies that Cole has "let hip-hop down" by apologizing and stepping back from the battle. Krishnamurthy is critical of others in the community who have been accepting of Cole's concession, and writes: 

> Surrendering sets a precedent for rewarding participation with trophies. Rappers have become so consumed with being bros, worried about offending their political connections, and cozying up for selfies on Instagram that the lifeblood has been drained from hip-hop in recent years (the notable exception is female rappers, who have remained doggedly competitive).

She concludes quoting Ebro Darden: 

> Hot 97's Ebro Darden agrees, writing in part on X, "You can't EVER be considered THE BEST of a generation in rap after playing your cards this way."

> If fans want the next 50 years of hip-hop to be great, the greatest artists need to step up.

I don't claim to be any sort of expert on J Cole, Kendrick, or hip hop more generally and its culture of competition[^1]; and as an affluent white guy who is mostly an outsider to the hip hop world, I don't claim my opinion is worth much here. Who am I to say what makes or will make hip-hop (or its artists) great. 

But with that said, Cole's statement resonates for me as a valuable example of a visible male role model publicly *being vulnerable* and discussing his struggle with the patriarchal cultural expectations placed on men to be strong, aggressive, competitive, and so on. As Cole's personal reflection highlights -- these cultural expectations are often blind to the personal emotional cost (or alientation) that they exact on men. 

What I also find compelling about the statement is the way Cole is really not blaming or criticizing anyone else. He describes his *personal* experience of the world's expectation of him, but does not claim that those expectations are right or wrong. He is not trying to make some broader critique of patriarchal masculinity or hip-hop culture, criticize others for participating in it, or use it as an execuse[^2]; instead, he is just saying honestly: *I* had this experience, *I* regret the decision that I made, and *I* apologize for it. It's about his own honest reflection on his decisions, and his desire to move forward according to his own understanding of what's right and what's best for his own personal, mental & spiritual health. 

Many "apologies" we see from public figures are quite the opposite of this: they involve some public figure *caving to* public pressure to recant for some past decision in hopes of staving off cancellation -- typically while taking as little personal responsibility as possible. Cole, by contrast, is proactively following his own moral compass, taking responsibility for what he sees as a mistake, and accepting consequences -- in spite of external pressure to the contrary. In this way, he's demonstrating a kind of personal honesty that is present in a lot of great art. 

Anyhow, it will be interesting to see how this all plays out culturally. While some commentators have been critical (per above), another thread of response (especially on Tik Tok) has comically commented on Cole's decision to choose peace (particularly in light of the beef between Drake & Kendrick intensifying); for example:

I also enjoyed this take from Christian Divyne, joking that J Cole will wind up winning the beef by process of elimination if Drake and Kendrick keep escalating and destroy each other:

This is all to say -- regardless of Cole's understandable expectation that the apology is "not what a lot of people want to hear" -- it's really still TBD how this will all wind up reflecting back on him culturally. We will have to see.
