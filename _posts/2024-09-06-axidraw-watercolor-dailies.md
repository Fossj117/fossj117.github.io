## Motivation

Lately, I have been thinking about the value of discipline and focus in creative work. For me, there can be an impulse to jump around when I'm in a "creative" headspace -- I want to work on what's exciting and engaging in the moment, which often involves trying or learning something new. 

While this approach can be motivating and enjoyable, it also has limitations. There are lots of interesting and rewarding projects that can only be completed with sustained focus and commmitment; focus allows for more completely exploring and refining an idea. Further, many projects involve some moments of frustration or annoyance at some point or another -- some tasks that I feel resistant towards completing. It can be difficult to work through these moments of resistance under the excitement-oriented approach. 

Finally, there's an energetic value to discipline and that I want to explore. Discipline and consistency have a grounded, stable, secure feeling that contrasts with the untethered, fluid, uncertain energy of novelty and excitement. 

With that in mind, I am doing some experiments in creative consistency. Here is one experiment. Today is Sunday. Each day this week, I am going to make one generative drawing in a series. There will be seven drawings in the series, and they will all be made using the same (or a similar) process. The process I want to explore is involves combining generative art and the axidraw with water-soluble fountain pen ink and watercolors. 

## Design

I have two sheets of leftover 9x12" watercolor paper; I will divide them into 4x6" rectangles for the drawings. The drawings will have a 1/2" border, so the main drawings will be 3x5". I have a simple concept in mind for the generative drawings. 

Here is the plan: 

1. Split the canvas into an array of squares. 
2. Create a "fracture" from top to bottom of the canvas. 
3. Fill squares in different ways in relation to their distance from the fracture. 

I want to pair the machine drawing with some hand water-coloring, so I will go in with that at the end.

## Results 

### Day One

Here is the result for day 1, before and after water colors: 

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  <img src="/figs/2024-09-06-axidraw-watercolor-dailies/day1.jpg" alt="Image 1" style="width: 45%; max-width: 45%" >
  <img src="/figs/2024-09-06-axidraw-watercolor-dailies/day1wc.jpg" alt="Image 2" style="width: 45%; max-width: 45%">
</div>

I don't like these results much. The pen drawing is messy, and the watercolor felt unintentional and disconnected. I wasn't really sure what my plan was. But the goal of this experiment is to iterate, trust the process. What can i do different tomorrow? 

I think tomorrow I will try using water-soluble fountain pen ink. That was my original plan, but i wasn't set up for it. I hope it will connect the pen and the watercolor more. I will go lighter on the fill as well, and introduce some more variation in the design. 

I think this piece is about something like the boundary between control and uncertainty. Maybe I'll try putting the colors in a different place. Maybe there should be some white space remaining. Maybe I should invert the positive and negative space. Maybe I should allow for more variation in the fill distributions across the vertical dimension of the piece.  

### Day Two

Here is the result for day 2; I wound up doing two today. I also started naming them.

These are still pretty simple in terms of outputs, but I am starting to find them a bit more interesting. I used the water soluble ink and used a watercolor brush to paint just water on to the canvas before and as the drawing was happening. In general, I am interested in work that emerges from some complex interaction of machine, human, and natural elements like water. 

In this process, the routing of the pen plotting algorithm and the application of volume of the water (and its rate of drying) matter a lot. Something I found interesting is layering, and so i want to think about how to explore that more.

What else? How might I make this more interesting? More colors, more feedback? More complexity in the digital design? Perhaps the application of the water might be even more dynamic and interactive.

### Day Three 

Today's first experiment involves some [automatic drawing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrealist_automatism) with watercolor pencils. The result is chaotic and not too appealing for me, but there's something conceptually interesting about the idea of combining human and machine automatism, alongside an injection of natural randomness (water).

In my second experiment of the day, I explored using watercolors again directly, here adding bits of sage green pigment.

Some bits of this get too heavy for me; but I like other bits somewhat more -- mainly the places where the regimented squares peek through in "shadow" and/or blend with the sage pigment. Here is a detail:

Maybe I wille explore some more deliberate placement of the water on the canvas. 

### Day Four

Today i returned to direct watercolor. I generated the plotter design and then made some watercolor forms by hand loosely related to the negative space in the generative design. I used heavy water and left it pooled on the canvas, and then plotted into it. I used some salt granules to explore creating different textures in the watercolor. Here is the result:

In the algorithm, I lightened the amount of fills, and allowed for partial squares. I think less fill was good in this scale to not overwhelm the watercolor. I continue to be most interested in the boundary areas in these designs -- e.g. the squares plotted into pooled water leaving hazy outlines. I also like the color variation here, expressing the blue-greenish undertones of the black ink and also their dilution and mixture with the water and watercolor pigments. I want maybe to explore more layering, whether of color or the plotted work.
