I am doing some experiments in creative consistency. Today is Sunday. Each day this week, I am going to make one generative drawing in a series. There will be seven drawings in the series, and they will all be made using the same (or a similar) process. The process I want to explore involves combining generative art and the axidraw with water-soluble fountain pen ink and watercolors. 

## Day One

Here is the result for day 1, before and after water colors: 

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  <img src="/figs/2024-09-06-axidraw-watercolor-dailies/day1.jpg" alt="Image 1" style="width: 45%; max-width: 45%" >
  <img src="/figs/2024-09-06-axidraw-watercolor-dailies/day1wc.jpg" alt="Image 2" style="width: 45%; max-width: 45%">
</div>

I don't like these results much. The pen drawing is messy, and the watercolor felt unintentional and disconnected. I wasn't really sure what my plan was. But the goal of this experiment is to iterate, trust the process. What can i do different tomorrow? 

I think tomorrow I will try using water-soluble fountain pen ink. That was my original plan, but i wasn't set up for it. I hope it will connect the pen and the watercolor more. I will go lighter on the fill as well, and introduce some more variation in the design. 

I think this piece is about something like the boundary between control and uncertainty. Maybe I'll try putting the colors in a different place. Maybe there should be some white space remaining. Maybe I should invert the positive and negative space. Maybe I should allow for more variation in the fill distributions across the vertical dimension of the piece.  

## Day Two

Here is the result for day 2; I wound up doing two today. I also started naming them.

</div>

These are still pretty simple in terms of outputs, but I am starting to find them a bit more interesting. I used the water soluble ink and used a watercolor brush to paint just water on to the canvas before and as the drawing was happening. In general, I am interested in work that emerges from some complex interaction of machine, human, and natural elements like water. 

In this process, the routing of the pen plotting algorithm and the application of volume of the water (and its rate of drying) matter a lot. Something I found interesting is layering, and so i want to think about how to explore that more.

What else? How might I make this more interesting? More colors, more feedback? More complexity in the digital design? Perhaps the application of the water might be even more dynamic and interactive.

## Day Three 

Today's first experiment involves some [automatic drawing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrealist_automatism) with watercolor pencils. The result is chaotic and not too appealing for me, but there's something conceptually interesting about the idea of combining human and machine automatism, alongside an injection of natural randomness (water).

In my second experiment of the day, I explored using watercolors again directly, here adding bits of sage green pigment.

</div>

Some bits of this get too heavy for me; but I like other bits somewhat more -- mainly the places where the regimented squares peek through in "shadow" and/or blend with the sage pigment. Here is a detail:

Maybe I wille explore some more deliberate placement of the water on the canvas. 

## Day Four

Today i returned to direct watercolor. I generated the plotter design and then made some watercolor forms by hand loosely related to the negative space in the generative design. I used heavy water and left it pooled on the canvas, and then plotted into it. I used some salt granules to explore creating different textures in the watercolor. Here is the result: 

<div align="center">

</div>

In the algorithm, I lightened the amount of fills, and allowed for partial squares. I think less fill was good in this scale to not overwhelm the watercolor. I continue to be most interested in the boundary areas in these designs -- e.g. the squares plotted into pooled water leaving hazy outlines. I also like the color variation here, expressing the blue-greenish undertones of the black ink and also their dilution and mixture with the water and watercolor pigments. I want maybe to explore more layering, whether of color or the plotted work. 

## Day Five

More watercolor today.

<img src="/figs/2024-09-06-axidraw-watercolor-dailies/day5.jpg" alt="Intervals" style="width: 50%;" />

*Intervals* 

</div>

I like some of the layering and blending in this one. I am interested in exploring a process with more layering. 

## Day Six

Watercolor greens and blues, a bit of salt, and pulling back on volume.

## Day Seven

I was walking the other day with Elspeth and we went past this curb we call the "curb of requirement", which is variously populated with all sorts of crafty or collectible odds and ends. On that day there was a wide range of sheet music laid out, so I picked up a book of Prokofiev piano solos, with the idea of integrating it into this work. I like allowing the world's spontanaeity to partially direct my creative explorations, and point me in directions I might not otherwise explore. 

<div align="center">

<img src="/figs/2024-09-06-axidraw-watercolor-dailies/day7.jpg" alt="Prokofiev" style="width: 50%;" />

*Prokofiev* 

</div>

I also explored a bit more layering and color variation in this sketch which I think is good. For me, I think the direction to take this process probably involves more texture, layering, and depth, and perhaps a slightly larger piece that would allow for more complexity. I have been wondering too about exploring other colors of fountain pen ink (or even black inks with different color undertones) for different layers. 

## Conclusion

I decided that to end this experiment, I want to make a little Instagram / Tik Tok video reflecting on my experiments here. Here is the video:

Someone commented on the video using the term "cyborg art" which I relate to. It makes me want to re-read *A Cyborg Manifesto* and other Haraway which is perpetually in the background of my thinking. I was also reminded of this poem that I co-created with an LLM a while back about making art with machines: 

<blockquote>
Who is creator - machine or me?  
Neurons, circuits, shared electricity.  
It beeps, I whir; we click into place  
I share its metal arm, we trace  
The lines together, dance of creation -  
Is this art or automation?  
Cyborg muse or an empty mind,  
Is it art if it's not all mine?  
</blockquote>

Transcript. 

This week I have been doing these daily sketches exploring a new creative process (for me) that involves using my computer-controlled drawing machine in combination with water and water color paints, as well as a fountain pen with water soluble ink. 

I tried a few variants of the process over the course of the week, but the version that seems to yield the most interesting results so far involves doing some watercolor on paper first and then using the drawing machine on top of that, while the paper is still wet. 

That version of the process allows for a lot of interaction between the watercolor and the machine drawing. ==> because I am using the fountain pen with water soluble ink, the computer drawing can bleed and mix in various ways when the paper is damp. It seems that the fountain pen can also pick up the water and watercolor pigment in different amounts, which can create interesting variation in color and value. 

In general, there is a lot of unpredictability and uncertainty in this process, which is part of what makes it interesting, given that it's of course possible to use a drawing machine in a highly controlled and predictable way. 

In this case, the result that we actually get on the paper emerges from a mix of the procedural algorithmic design, the pathing algorithm for the plotter, and then all these natural variables connected with the watercolor, like exactly how damp the paper is in a particular place and how quickly it's drying, depending on how sunny it is outside. 

As I explore this process more, I'm interested in trying to add more layering and depth, possibly using multiple iterations of this tradeoff between the watercolor and the pen plotting. 

Overall, I am conceptually interested in pen plotted work that in different ways pushes beyond thinking of the plotter as just like a big printer for precisely rendering some computational design in real life. 

Like an important part of what makes a pen plotter different from working with digital design purely on a computer screen is that it *is* this physical process, and you can have these creative dimensions that emerge from the physicality of the medium -- whether that's color bleeding or blending, or working with paint.

Thematically, I also think that that's really interesting in terms of exploring this broader idea about how our even quite rigorously-designed technological systems can be brittle or can behave in unexpected ways when they come into contact with the complexity of the real world. 

There's a handful of cool pen plotter artists on social media exploring this kind of direction in different ways, and I'll tag some in the description. 

Anyways, I'd be curious to hear in the comments or messages from folks who have thoughts on this process and how we could iterate on and improve it. For me, I want to potentially explore some slightly larger and more complicated pieces in this theme, and/or try do some more layering -- possibly alternating between the hand painting and the machine drawing -- to hopefully add some more depth and contrast. 

Thanks for watching. 




Thematically, I also think that this type of work 







In general I think developing this idea by introducing more color and layering 




even within the computer-drawn pieces.

In general, I am conceptually interested in pen plotted work that in different ways pushes beyond thinking of the plotter as just like a big printer for precisely rendering some computational design in real life. 

For me, the most conceptually interesting work involves engaging the idea that there is a real physical process happening here. 

That engages the like physical materiality of the process. 

There's various versions of this.

I also want to say at the conclusion that I am not the first or only person to explore this kind of process. If you find this interesting you should check out idrawmonkeys and licia he who both do interestin gthings involving pen plotters and water or watercolor in different ways.

In general I think that this direction is interesting to me for a few reasons. First, I have always loved watercolors, and the element of unpredictability they have. 

NEXT: I want to combine this process with my MCMC drawing algorithm. 

- do a wash on the whole page
- do MCMC with little dots. Maybe a version where the amount of time that the pen stays down is a function of how dark the pixel is?
