For [Max Bazerman](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=6420), I built [this](https://jeffreyfossett.com/maxviz/) interactive visualization of his advisee network (i.e. everyone he has advised and who they have advised). This was a fun little project that involved using python (NetworkX) to process the network data, and javascript (Viz.js) to construct the visualization. All the code and raw data are available in github [here](https://github.com/Fossj117/maxviz).
