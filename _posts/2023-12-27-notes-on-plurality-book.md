In this post, I will keep some very rough notes about the [Plurality book](https://github.com/pluralitybook/plurality/tree/main/contents/english) led by Weyl and Tang. These notes are mostly for personal use, but I like the idea of documenting them publicly for various reasons. Maybe I will make a separate blog section for reading notes at some point.

## [Preface](https://github.com/pluralitybook/plurality/blob/main/contents/english/01-preface.md)

Reference to [The Declaration for the Future of the Internet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Declaration-for-the-Future-for-the-Internet_Launch-Event-Signing-Version_FINAL.pdf)

- Basically affirming liberal democratic values on the internet, against threats from authoritarian governments (firewalls, censorship) and dominant technology platforms
- "We affirm our commitment to promote and sustain an Internet that: is an open, free, global, interoperable, reliable, and secure and to ensure that the Internet reinforces democratic principles and human rights and fundamental freedoms; offers opportunities for collaborative research and commerce; is developed, governed, and deployed in an inclusive way so that unserved and underserved communities, particularly those coming online for the first time, can navigate it safely and with personal data privacy and protections in place; and is governed by multistakeholder processes. In short, an Internet that can deliver on the promise of connecting humankind and helping societies and democracies to thrive."
  - Principles outlined:
    - Protection of human rights
    - A global internet
    - Inclusive and affordable access
    - Trust in the digital ecosystem
    - Multistakeholder internet governance

What is Plurality?

- Goal to magnify and strengthen the virtue of cognitive diversity across borders.
- "The idea of Plurality captures the symbiotic relationship between democracy and collaborative technology. The challenge of digitally transforming democracy might seem daunting, but it is not insurmountable. By fusing democracy with technology, as we've shaped science with diversity, we can weave a fabric of trust for the public to nurture and cherish, breathing new life into our river of democracy"
- I think that this is one of the things that differentiates the plurality space from a more general focus on liberal democratic values -- namely a focus on technological development as an important site of investment / intervention in supporting democracy. Two related ideas:
  - Supporting the collaborative / democratic development of technologies like the internet _per se_
  - Understanding technology [as a mode of governance](https://jeffreyfossett.com/2023/10/18/my-lens-on-technology.html), as something [that has politics](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20024652), that can support or undermine broader social values like democracy. Clearly consonant with lots of STS ideas.

## [Introduction](https://github.com/pluralitybook/plurality/blob/main/contents/english/02-introduction.md)

Key idea is that there is currently a tension between (digital) technology and democracy. But this need not be the case.

- "the path technology and democracy as systems have taken have put them at loggerheads and the ensuing battle has claimed victims on both sides"
- Issues from recent developments in both AI and blockchain: "The dominant trends in technology in recent decades have been artificial intelligence and blockchains. These have, respectively, empowered centralized top-down control and turbo-charged atomized polarization and financial capitalism. Both outcomes are corrosive to the values of democratic pluralism"
  - I was a little surprised to see blockchain critiqued here, but I agree with the pieces critiqued. I want to understand more what they mean by "turbo-charged atomized polarization"
  - General skepticism that democracy is working well right now, partly because of its lethargy in keeping up technologically. Interesting to note the resonances here with [Scott and his brand of anarchism](https://jeffreyfossett.com/2023/12/20/notes-on-scott.html). Something I will be keeping an eye on in the plurality space is what version and "scale" of democracy seems to be the main focus; so far, I think I detect a set of values that are consonant with Scott (e.g. emphasizing small-scale participatory models over large-scale hierarchies even if democratic). But it will be interesting to keep an eye on this.

Key counterpoint: technology and democracy can be natural allies.

- "In this book we hope to show that this tragic conflict is avoidable, that properly conceived technology and democracy can be powerful and natural allies"
- This counterpoint relies on the key analytical point (rightly attributed to STS thinkers) that the direction of technological development is not inevitable. That there are many potential pathways which can have many possible effects on the social and democratic order.
  - They reference various future technological visions, which I would think of basically as "[sociotechnical imaginaries](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/D/bo20836025.html)".
  - The main ones they higlight are "Abundance Technocracy" and "Entrepreneurial Sovereignty"

The goal of the book, then, is to flesh out a different imaginary -- "Digital Democracy" wherein technology and democracy are mutually supportive.

Other takeaways for me on this section are that I should definitely read [the new Acemoglu book](https://www.amazon.com/Power-Progress-Thousand-Year-Technology-Prosperity/dp/1541702530) and more deeply in his technology research agenda in general.

From the STS side, I think there are clear resonances with someone [Yaron Ezrahi](https://www.amazon.com/Descent-Icarus-Transformation-Contemporary-Democracy/dp/067419828X) in addition to the Jasanoff work noted above. I need to re-read this and dive into it more deeply.

In general, one of the things on display in this chapter that excites me about the plurality research agenda is the way it manages to borrow from various fields that I am interested in in exactly the pieces that I think are most appropriate. In other words, if plurality is a venn diagram that includes economics, STS, web3 among other fields, the parts of these various fields that I find most compelling are exactly those that seem to overlap in the venn diagram with Plurality.

- For example, I think there are some interesting things happening in the blockchain space (e.g. experiments in new modes of digital governance), but there is also a lot of junk especially related to over-financialization in the space; the plurality agenda seems to carve out exactly the right boundary here.
- Similarly with the econ and STS spaces. I often feel that the econ of technology world could learn more from STS, especially STS' emphasis on the contingency of technological pathways and its skepticism towards technological determinism. Weyl and Tang highlight exactly this point, and focus on the part of the economics world that _does_ rightly integrate this consideration (i.e. Acemoglu's work).

## [A View from Yu Shan]https://github.com/pluralitybook/plurality/blob/main/contents/english/03-00-a-view-from-yu-shan.md)

This section of the book seems to be largerly under development still at the time of my reading. However, the section cites some important milestones in Taiwan's digital democracy which I can learn more about from elsewhere:

**318 Sunflower Movement**: student protest movement protesting a trade deal between Taiwan and China which protestors thought would increase Taiwan's dependence on China and leave it vulnerable to political pressure. Per [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audrey_Tang#Political_career), this movement was the start of Audrey Tang's political career, and led to their first political appointments. I would like to learn more about this.

**PDIS**: I think this is the the [Public Digital Innovation Space](https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/). Via LinkedIn: "PDIS is a team of creative minds working with the Digital Minister in Executive Yuan, government of Taiwan, leading digital transformation and open government movement."

**The Digital Ministry**: The [ministry of digital affairs in Taiwan](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Digital_Affairs_(Taiwan)>), which I'd also like to learn more about

Incidentally, I noticed as I was googling about these that, indeed, Tang identifies as a "conservative anarchist" in the sense described [here](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Digital_Affairs_(Taiwan)>). Essentially, her politics emphasize voluntary cooperation rather than top-down hierarchy (whether from the state or capitalist actors) in the anarchist sense; the "conservative" modifier seems to refer to a respect for the diversity of existing cultures and traditions that exist in Taiwan, and a desire to preseve these. In practice, Tang seems to connect these values with an emphasis on radical openness and transparency. I would be interested to see this political perspective expanded on further.
