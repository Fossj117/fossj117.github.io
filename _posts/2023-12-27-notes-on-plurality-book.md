In this post, I will keep some very rough notes about the [Plurality book](https://github.com/pluralitybook/plurality/tree/main/contents/english) led by Weyl and Tang. These notes are mostly for personal use, but I like the idea of documenting them publicly for various reasons. Maybe I will make a separate blog section for reading notes at some point.

## [Preface](https://github.com/pluralitybook/plurality/blob/main/contents/english/01-preface.md)

Reference to [The Declaration for the Future of the Internet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Declaration-for-the-Future-for-the-Internet_Launch-Event-Signing-Version_FINAL.pdf)

- Basically affirming liberal democratic values on the internet, against threats from authoritarian governments (firewalls, censorship) and dominant technology platforms
- "We affirm our commitment to promote and sustain an Internet that: is an open, free, global, interoperable, reliable, and secure and to ensure that the Internet reinforces democratic principles and human rights and fundamental freedoms; offers opportunities for collaborative research and commerce; is developed, governed, and deployed in an inclusive way so that unserved and underserved communities, particularly those coming online for the first time, can navigate it safely and with personal data privacy and protections in place; and is governed by multistakeholder processes. In short, an Internet that can deliver on the promise of connecting humankind and helping societies and democracies to thrive."
  - Principles outlined:
    - Protection of human rights
    - A global internet
    - Inclusive and affordable access
    - Trust in the digital ecosystem
    - Multistakeholder internet governance

What is Plurality?

- Goal to magnify and strengthen the virtue of cognitive diversity across borders.
- "The idea of Plurality captures the symbiotic relationship between democracy and collaborative technology. The challenge of digitally transforming democracy might seem daunting, but it is not insurmountable. By fusing democracy with technology, as we've shaped science with diversity, we can weave a fabric of trust for the public to nurture and cherish, breathing new life into our river of democracy"
- I think that this is one of the things that differentiates the plurality space from a more general focus on liberal democratic values -- namely a focus on technological development as an important site of investment / intervention in supporting democracy. Two related ideas:
  - Supporting the collaborative / democratic development of technologies like the internet _per se_
  - Understanding technology [as a mode of governance](https://jeffreyfossett.com/2023/10/18/my-lens-on-technology.html), as something [that has politics](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20024652), that can support or undermine broader social values like democracy. Clearly consonant with lots of STS ideas.

## [Introduction](https://github.com/pluralitybook/plurality/blob/main/contents/english/02-introduction.md)

Key idea is that there is currently a tension between (digital) technology and democracy. But this need not be the case.

- "the path technology and democracy as systems have taken have put them at loggerheads and the ensuing battle has claimed victims on both sides"
- Issues from recent developments in both AI and blockchain: "The dominant trends in technology in recent decades have been artificial intelligence and blockchains. These have, respectively, empowered centralized top-down control and turbo-charged atomized polarization and financial capitalism. Both outcomes are corrosive to the values of democratic pluralism"
  - I was a little surprised to see blockchain critiqued here, but I agree with the pieces critiqued. I want to understand more what they mean by "turbo-charged atomized polarization"
  - General skepticism that democracy is working well right now, partly because of its lethargy in keeping up technologically. Interesting to note the resonances here with [Scott and his brand of anarchism](https://jeffreyfossett.com/2023/12/20/notes-on-scott.html). Something I will be keeping an eye on in the plurality space is what version and "scale" of democracy seems to be the main focus; so far, I think I detect a set of values that are consonant with Scott (e.g. emphasizing small-scale participatory models over large-scale hierarchies even if democratic). But it will be interesting to keep an eye on this.

Key counterpoint: technology and democracy can be natural allies.

- "In this book we hope to show that this tragic conflict is avoidable, that properly conceived technology and democracy can be powerful and natural allies"
- This counterpoint relies on the key analytical point (rightly attributed to STS thinkers) that the direction of technological development is not inevitable. That there are many potential pathways which can have many possible effects on the social and democratic order.
  - They reference various future technological visions, which I would think of basically as "[sociotechnical imaginaries](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/D/bo20836025.html)".
  - The main ones they higlight are "Abundance Technocracy" and "Entrepreneurial Sovereignty"

The goal of the book, then, is to flesh out a different imaginary -- "Digital Democracy" wherein technology and democracy are mutually supportive.

Other takeaways for me on this section are that I should definitely read [the new Acemoglu book](https://www.amazon.com/Power-Progress-Thousand-Year-Technology-Prosperity/dp/1541702530) and more deeply in his technology research agenda in general.

From the STS side, I think there are clear resonances with someone [Yaron Ezrahi](https://www.amazon.com/Descent-Icarus-Transformation-Contemporary-Democracy/dp/067419828X) in addition to the Jasanoff work noted above. I need to re-read this and dive into it more deeply.

In general, one of the things on display in this chapter that excites me about the plurality research agenda is the way it manages to borrow from various fields that I am interested in in exactly the pieces that I think are most appropriate. In other words, if plurality is a venn diagram that includes economics, STS, web3 among other fields, the parts of these various fields that I find most compelling are exactly those that seem to overlap in the venn diagram with Plurality.

- For example, I think there are some interesting things happening in the blockchain space (e.g. experiments in new modes of digital governance), but there is also a lot of junk especially related to over-financialization in the space; the plurality agenda seems to carve out exactly the right boundary here.
- Similarly with the econ and STS spaces. I often feel that the econ of technology world could learn more from STS, especially STS' emphasis on the contingency of technological pathways and its skepticism towards technological determinism. Weyl and Tang highlight exactly this point, and focus on the part of the economics world that _does_ rightly integrate this consideration (i.e. Acemoglu's work).

## [A View from Yu Shan](https://github.com/pluralitybook/plurality/blob/main/contents/english/03-00-a-view-from-yu-shan.md)

This section of the book seems to be largerly under development still at the time of my reading. However, the section cites some important milestones in Taiwan's digital democracy which I can learn more about from elsewhere:

- **318 Sunflower Movement**: student protest movement protesting a trade deal between Taiwan and China which protestors thought would increase Taiwan's dependence on China and leave it vulnerable to political pressure. Per [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audrey_Tang#Political_career), this movement was the start of Audrey Tang's political career, and led to their first political appointments. I would like to learn more about this.
- **PDIS**: I think this is the the [Public Digital Innovation Space](https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/). Via LinkedIn: "PDIS is a team of creative minds working with the Digital Minister in Executive Yuan, government of Taiwan, leading digital transformation and open government movement."
- **The Digital Ministry**: The [ministry of digital affairs in Taiwan](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Digital_Affairs_(Taiwan)>), which I'd also like to learn more about

Incidentally, I noticed as I was googling about these that, indeed, Tang identifies as a "conservative anarchist" in the sense described [here](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Digital_Affairs_(Taiwan)>). Essentially, her politics emphasize voluntary cooperation rather than top-down hierarchy (whether from the state or capitalist actors) in the anarchist sense; the "conservative" modifier seems to refer to a respect for the diversity of existing cultures and traditions that exist in Taiwan, and a desire to preseve these. In practice, Tang seems to connect these values with an emphasis on radical openness and transparency. I would be interested to see this political perspective expanded on further.

## [Living in a Plural World](https://github.com/pluralitybook/plurality/blob/main/contents/english/03-01-living-in-a-plural-world.md)

Basic idea of this section is to think about different conceptual foundations of science, and explain how these lead to the different sociotechnical imaginaries outlined in the previous section. The section is pretty ranging (perhaps a bit too much so); but my understanding of the basic ideas:

- They first define the "monist atomist" understanding of science and argue that it informs the Abundance Technocracy (AT) and Entrepreneurial Sovereignty (ES) worldviews outlined in the previous chapters.
- The monist atomist view understands the physical (or social) world as having an objective state and as obeying an ultimately simple set of laws, waiting to be discovered. There's a commitment to a kind of reductionism here -- breaking complex phenomena down to atomic parts, which can be modeled in clear mathematical terms.
- The monist atomist / reductionist approach is then contrasted with scientific paradigms based in complexity, emergence, networks and collective intellgience.
- They argue that the latter paradigm has been influential across a range of scientific fields over the past century or so including math, physics, neuroscience and biology
- The rough idea is then to align the plurality project with this latter set of paradigms. Very coarsely: "monist atomist" is to AT/ES as "complexity/emergence/collective intelligence" are to the plural sociotechnical imaginary (DD?) that they are trying to develop.

Here is one way that this is stated (my parenthetical):

> Plurality is, scientifically, the application of an analogous perspective (to that of the complexity/emergence/network/collective intelligence paradigms) to the understanding of human societies and, technologically, the attempt to build formal information and governance systems that account for and resemble these structures as physical technologies built on plural science

There is an extended discussion of Granovetter and network sociology themes, which is contrasted with the methodological individualism of economics. Interestingly, "science of science" is aligned with the former.

I have a lot of thoughts on this section that I need to process more. One thing that I would like to see more of here is a connection with how STS scholars think about knowledge and expertise as a governing technology/institution in society. Thus when thinking about "plural" (social) science, the goal should not be just to integrate e.g. more network science considerations into economic modeling, while retaining the rest of the technocratic knowledge-making aparatus as is; instead, I think it should be more about how to pluralize/democratize the tools and systems of knowledge making, and thinking about how to mediate between different modes of knowing -- e.g. as I've discussed a bit [here](https://jeffreyfossett.com/2023/10/25/brainstorm-on-plurality-and-quant-social-science.html). I think this idea is also present more abstractly e.g. in [Latour](https://jeffreyfossett.com/2021/10/19/we-have-never-been-modern.html) and others.

## [The Lost DAO](https://github.com/pluralitybook/plurality/blob/main/contents/english/03-02-the-lost-dao.md)

<!-- They connect to network science, Granovetter.

> While we have emphasized the positive vision of pluralistic social science (a “network society”), it is important to note that beyond its inherent plausibility, a key reason for adopting such a perspective is the impossibility of explaining most social problems using monistic atomism given both complexity and chaos. Even in the social science field, economics, that most consistently aims for “methodological individualism”, it is universally accepted that trying to model complex organizations exclusively as the outgrowth of individual behavior is unpromising.

I feel like this is not reflecting on the more important aspect of plural social science. Plurality in the creation of social scientific knowledge...

> Yet, whatever level of explanation is chosen [in economics], actors are almost always modeled as atomistically self-interested and planners as coherent, objective maximizers, rather than socially-embedded intersections of group affiliations

Instead, plurality seeks to capture:

> social nature of motivations, to empower a diversity of social groups, to anticipate and support social dynamism and evolution, to ground personal identity in social affiliations and group choices in collective, democratic participation and to facilitate the establishment and maintenance of social context facilitating community.

I think for me a richer perspective here would focus on the role of plurality in the making of scientific and expert knowledge in society.

<!-- * "The simplest and most naïve way to think about science is what might be called “objectivist”, “rationalist” or, as we will dub it, “monist atomism”3. The physical world has an objective state and obeys an ultimately quite simple set of laws, waiting to be discovered"
* "They are also the foundation of the Abundance Technocracy (AT) and Entrepreneurial Sovereignty (ES) worldviews we discussed in the last chapter, though each emphasizes a different aspect. AT focuses on the unity of reason and science inherent in monism and seeks to similarly rationalize social life, harnessing technology. ES focuses on the fragmentation intrinsic to atomism and seeks to model “natural laws” for the interaction of these atoms (like natural selection and market processes). In this sense, while ES and AT seem opposite, they are opposites within an aligned scientific worldview."
* "Critical to all these developments are ideas such as “complexity”, “emergence”, “networks”, and “collective intelligence” that challenge the elegance of monist atomism." --> -->
