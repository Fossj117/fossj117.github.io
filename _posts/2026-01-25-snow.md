There was a big snow today. Outside my window I can see just these patterns of the snow swirling, sometimes "falling" but other times wooshing in different directions. The above is based on a video, processed with code to try to emphasize this flow and tumble. The sound is artificial, but something like wind. Best watched full screen.
