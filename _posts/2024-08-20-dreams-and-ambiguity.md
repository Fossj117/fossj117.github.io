For some reason, I started remembering a lot more of my dreams recently. Dreams are, of course, fascinating and so I've been doing my best to further cultivate this ability. When I wake up, I try to write down or record everything I can recall before it dissolves.

One thing that I have been thinking about is how, in dreams, *ambiguity* can be durable in a way that is either intolerable or impossible in the "real" world.

For example, a I had a recent dream that included a character that was visually ambiguous. In the dream experience, the character played an important narrative role--they spoke, they did things, we interacted--but the way that they looked was unspecified. It's not that the character was visually blurry or hard to make out--instead, its visual characteristics were simply unselected. Despite this, there was also somehow dream clarity that the character was "tall"--a fact which usually requires visual input to know. In the dream, this knowledge was not available because I could visually "see" their height, but somehow independently of this. 

I guess it is similar to reading a story about a character who is described as "tall" but is otherwise not characterized physically. How do you imagine such a chacter in your mind's eye? Do they take on some particular visual form with the undescrived details filled in? Or do they exist as an otherwise-undifferentiated "tall" character. 

Or similarly, say you stood in a room with your eyes closed and then someone you didn't know came in the door and told you they were tall in the course of conversation. Or maybe you could discern that their voice was coming from above you. How do you perceive them? 

I think what I find interesting in my dream version of this experience is the way that this ambiguity was experienced in a first-person narrative kind of way, and yet fully tolerated/assimilated. There was no experience of lack, or need to visually clarify. In dreams, ambiguities or paradoxes are accepted as though they make perfect sense. 

In the real world, it seems that there is lots of conflict and difficulty that arises from an unwillingness or inability to tolerate things that are boundary-crossing, or don't fit neatly or logically into established categories. Likewise, we fear the dark, the unknown, the uncertainty of the future. Against this background, it's interesting that dreams can offer a first-person experience of what an alternative approach is like.
