For my PhD field exam, I developed a list of papers to familiarize myself with across several areas of economics that I am interested in, including:

- Economics of Innovation
- Economics of Digitization & the Internet
- Labor Economics & Technology

Since this might be useful for others (or for me in the future), I wanted to post the list [here]({% link /files/field_exam_reading_list.pdf %}). It's also a reflection of a selection of my interests in the economics world (at least as of May 2020).

Check it out!
