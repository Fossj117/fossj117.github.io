I was talking to [Jesse](https://jessecallahanbryant.substack.com/) about gardening and growing food and was inspired to try growing something in my apartment. I had a few ideas, but I settled on trying to grow some baby spinach. I have recently been making a lot of smoothies with baby spinach as a green ingredient, so I thought it would be a good one to attempt. Also, the internet told me it's not too tough to grow.

## Getting set up

To get myself started, I went over to the local [garden store](https://pembertonmarketplace.com/) and picked up this packet of seeds:

</div>

The packet came with some fairly detailed growing instructions which I did my best to follow. I picked up some shallow containers and [this](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CBSNPVT5?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1) seed starter mix as a medium. I am not sure what makes one medium meanignfully different from another or why this one is (or claims to be) "excellent" for "seed germination and growth of young seedlings". I'd like to learn more about this. 

I am not sure the best setup for watering and drainage, but I drilled some holes in the bottom of one of my containers and then nested it in another:

</div>
</center>

In the future, I'd like to figure out a nice system to do my watering and drainage. I will have to experiment a bit to see what works. 

A few accumulated bits of gardening lingo in my own words:

* **Medium**: the material that the plants grow in -- i.e. the soil (or whatever else). 
* **Sowing**: Sowing seeds means planting them. I really like this word for some reason. I like that there is a special word for this.

## December 13

I sewed my first set of seeds. Here is a picture:

  <img src="/figs/2025-12-11-spinach-notes/covered.jpg" alt="Covered seeds" style="width: 45%; max-width: 45%">
</div>
</center>

A few notes: 

* I tried for a bit over 2" of the seed mix, and put paper towels down on the bottom in hopes of keeping the soil from leaking out the holes. 
* The packet suggested sowing the seeds about a 1/2" down which I tried to do; I planted them an inch or so apart. I'm not sure if I got the seeds deep enough, but we will see.  

After covering the seeds, I watered them. I started by trying to bottom-water them, pouring about half my watering can into the container below and then letting it soak up through the holes for about 20-30 minutes. However, I am not sure how well this worked; it didn't seem like the top of the soil got damp. To be sure things got thoroughly watered, I also thoroughly sprayed the top of the soil with a spray bottle. I'm not sure the best way to make sure that things are thoroughly and appropriately watered.  

## December 14

Checking in this morning. The soil still feels damp so I will not water. I stuck my finger in a few inches and it seems to be damp throughout which I think is the goal. 

Maybe someday I will invest in a better way to tell if the soil is moist throughout. For now I'll just stick with my fingers I guess. 

Some more words: 

**Bolting**: "Bolting occurs when a plant begins to flower and set seed too early" ([source](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/ways-to-prevent-vegetables-from-bolting)). The idea is that the plant is choosing to focus on seeding and reproduction rather than growing leaves. In the case of spinach this apparently means that the leaves become more bitter. According to the internet, plants "bolt as a response to stressful situations" like when it's too hot or there is not enough water. Once bolting starts it is "irreversible". [Here](https://www.gardenary.com/blog/are-your-plants-bolting-heres-what-that-means) is another link about bolting. 

**Succession planting**: As described by [this](https://www.gardenary.com/blog/extend-your-growing-season-and-maximize-your-harvests-with-successive-sowing) link: 

> Succession planting, or successive sowing as it's also called by many gardeners, basically means to plant continuous rounds of seeds in the kitchen garden. I like to think of it as “never stop sowing”.
