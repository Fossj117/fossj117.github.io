I was thinking about making a submission to the [Cambridge Sidewalk Poetry Contest](https://www.cambridgema.gov/arts/Programs/sidewalkpoetry). The winning poems are stamped in concrete as part of the city's sidwalk repair program. Here are a few silly poems I came up with that seemed good for sidewalks. A first untitled one: 

<p class="poem">
Can’t tell you where the sidewalk ends,<br>
But it surely isn’t here.<br>
Another square of pavement walking,<br>
Ever ready near.<br>
But if this isn’t where the sidewalk ends<br>
Then perhaps it’s a beginning—<br>
New chance for walking, seeing, doing,<br>
New adventures to appear.<br>
</p>

This got me in a Shel Silverstein headspace which then led to this one I called "Worry Croc": 

<p class="poem">
Deep below this sidewalk,<br>
There lives a worry croc.<br> 
He paddles ‘round the sewers,<br>
Waiting memories to drop.<br>
He listens as you walk around,<br>
Tapping on his ceiling<br>
And hopes you’ll leave a scary thought<br>
Or melancholy feeling.<br>
So as you’re passing by<br>
Release your worried feel.<br>
Let croc gobble up your fears<br>
And enjoy a tasty meal.<br>
</p>

And this one: 

<p class="poem">
Somewhere there’s a sidewalk<br>
Nestled in the clouds.<br>
It’s for all the walking birds<br>
Who are tired of flying around.<br>
The walking birds<br>
Use crossing walks<br>
To cross the flying street,<br>
Or sometimes flap a little more,<br>
To fly up off their feet.
</p>

I think Worry Croc was my favorite, but it didn't quite fit the contest constraints (and I couldn't quite figure out how to edit it down), so I didn't wind up submitting anything. Maybe next year!
