I appreciate [blind contour drawing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_contour_drawing) for how it centers drawing practice around mindfulness, attention, & process rather than getting a particular result. I also like the natural, human quality of the lines that it produces. This drawing was not fully “blind”, but was approached in that spirit. I then added some watercolor at the end. I like the final result. Posting as part of my ongoing effort to document more things.
