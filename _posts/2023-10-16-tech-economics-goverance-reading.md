[Ryan](https://ryansepassi.com/) and I (and sometimes including [Kassandra](https://twitter.com/kassandraETH?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor), [Jesse](https://jessecallahanbryant.com/) and others) have been meeting regularly to read and discuss around a set of themes connected to digital technology governance, politics, and economics with a bent towards cooperative/democratic/public interest/pluralistic/progressive themes. In this post, I will keep tabs on some of our reading; I'll also keep a list of other things I find interesting on these themes. Some reading we have worked through (to various extents) so far:

- [_Radical Markets_](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691177502/radical-markets) by Weyl & Posner; especially chapters on Harberger taxes and quadratic voting.

My notes on various readings from the course are [here](https://jeffreyfossett.com/2024/01/05/decentralized-society-IAP.html). Some key readings I will hope to think on more:

Ryan and I are also interested in reading/thinking/building in a more applied vein on these themes, so that may be a direction going forward.
