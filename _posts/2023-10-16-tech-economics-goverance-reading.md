_First posted_: October 16, 2023.

[Ryan](https://ryansepassi.com/) and I (and sometimes including [Kassandra](https://twitter.com/kassandraETH?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor), [Jesse](https://jessecallahanbryant.com/) and others) have been meeting regularly to read and discuss around a set of themes connected to digital technology governance, politics, and economics with a bent towards cooperative/democratic/pluralistic themes. In this post, I will keep tabs on some of our reading; I'll also keep a list of other things I find interesting on these themes.

Some reading we have worked through (to various extents) so far:

- [_Radical Markets_](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691177502/radical-markets) by Weyl & Posner; especially chapters on Harberger taxes and quadratic voting.
- [_Governing the Commons_](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/governing-the-commons/A8BB63BC4A1433A50A3FB92EDBBB97D5) by Ostrom.
- [_Code 2.0_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code:_Version_2.0) by Lessig (Note I have some [prior](https://jeffreyfossett.com/2021/04/12/lessig-code-resonances.html) [posts](https://jeffreyfossett.com/2021/04/14/more-lessig-code-reflections.html) from an earlier reading on this site)
- [Moloch Ventures whitepaper](https://github.com/MolochVentures/Whitepaper/blob/master/Whitepaper.pdf)
- [_Two Cheers for Anarchism_](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691161037/two-cheers-for-anarchism) by James Scott. ([My Notes](https://jeffreyfossett.com/2023/12/20/notes-on-scott.html))
- [Ryan](https://ryansepassi.com/) and I were in [this](https://www.ccc.mit.edu/eventopportunities/iap-2024-decentralized-society-cooperation-and-plurality/) IAP class at MIT on "Decentralized Society, Cooperation, and Plurality", which fit in well with these themes. My notes on various readings from the course are [here](https://jeffreyfossett.com/2024/01/05/decentralized-society-IAP.html). Some key readings I will hope to think on more:
  - [Decentralized Society](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763) paper from Ohlhaver, Weyl, & Buterin.
  - [Toward a Connected Society](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9781400881260-006/html) from Allen.
  - On protocols and the Fediverse; on voting systems
- We discussed the recent [Epic v. Google decision](https://www.theverge.com/23945184/epic-v-google-fortnite-play-store-antitrust-trial-updates) and related issues (w/[Ryan](https://ryansepassi.com/) and [Jacob](https://www.rgrdlaw.com/attorneys-Jacob-G-Gelman.html)).
- [_The Public and Its Problems_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Public_and_Its_Problems) by John Dewey (w/ [Ryan](https://ryansepassi.com/), [Jesse](https://jessecallahanbryant.com/), [Jacob](https://www.rgrdlaw.com/attorneys-Jacob-G-Gelman.html) and [Zach](https://www.zachary-wojtowicz.com/))
