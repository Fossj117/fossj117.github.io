## Introduction

In [my](https://jeffreyfossett.com/2024/09/06/axidraw-watercolor-dailies.html) [creative](https://jeffreyfossett.com/2024/09/22/axidraw-watercolor-dailies-part2.html) work, I have so far  found it to be super helpful and grounding for me to have a daily habit and place to document my work. 

As such, today I am going to also start a trial run of "research" dailies, where I document my daily progress on my academic research. My goal for each day is to do at least one hour of "focused work" on one of the projects for my dissertation. But honestly, making any progress each day is better than nothing. Historically, my progress on research work has been sporadic -- I have periods where I get lots done, and periods where I get very little done. 

The goal of this daily practice is to build a more steady, grounded habit. Finishing a PhD -- or even a single research project -- is such a long journey, and one of the things I've learned is that I want to find ways to make more stable, steady progress. Bursts of motivation are just not reliable enough to push me through, especially when they're flanked by periods of feeling "stuck" and de-motivated. Making *any* progress each day -- even if it's small -- can feel hugely different from making *no* progress. At least with *any* progress I will get there eventually. 

So we will see how this daily practice goes. To start, I am setting a goal to do this for one week. Then I can re-evaluate and see how it went. Good luck to me. 

## Day 1

Well today started out weak. I did manage to accomplish my super duper tiny goal of sitting down and opening up the project that I ought to be working on. But this was only after spending most of the available day on other (productive, but non-research) things. I don't know why I find it so difficult to spend time on these projects. On the one hand, I think I am just not that excited about them any more. They've dragged on, and my self and my interests have changed, and I am just not so excited about using my brain in the ways that these projects require anymore. And in general, they therefore just feel instrumental. Like I just "have" to do them to finish the PhD so I can go on to do other things, despite this lack of motivation. On the other hand, I do know that it's possible for me to "get into" these projects -- it's a bit of a momentum thing. But it honestly feels humiliating/shameful or some mix of things like that to have such trouble getting myself to work on these things. I wish it were a bit easier to feel motivated around them.

Anyhow, I guess today was just not my day in terms of concrete success. But at least I did the minimal *some*thing. I am working on getting back in the flow here, so I will keep trying. I just need to break through back into the flow of this and get it over the finish line. What can I do better tomorrow in terms of organizing my day? Well, I have meetings / coursework 11-2 and a potential meeting at 430. In the morning I will do my personal work and then transition to research if there is any time. I will then go to meetings. After class I will come home and go out for a run/juggle for 1 hour; some cardio. This exercise, I hope, will give me the mental focus to do some more research work in the afternoon or early evening. 

## Day 2-3

I failed again on these days, and have been pre-occupied with other things. The other things have been decent and worthy things, but I need to get back on target here. I have not even published this post. 

## Day 4

Today I am meeting with the research team and am feeling more motivated. I need to create some accountability structure for myself to get this going. Here is the plan: 

1. I will have weekly meetings with the team. 
2. I will create some forcing function to complete the next draft by october 24th. 

Here we go.
