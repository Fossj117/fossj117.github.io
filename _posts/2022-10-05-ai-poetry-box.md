_This project is a collaboration with [Evan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/evanfinkle/) via [90percentart](https://90percentart.com/)_

One of the things I find interesting about generative AI is the potential to make relatively simple tools and devices substantially more quirky, dynamic, and surprising. With this in mind, Evan and I built a simple AI poetry box:

</center>
</p>

When you press the button, out comes a little AI-generated poem. The poems are generated via the OpenAI GPT-3 API, called from a Raspberry Pi that lives inside the 3D-printed box we made. The receipt printer is [this one](https://www.adafruit.com/product/597) from Adafruit.

</center>
</p>

The poems are a real grab bag -- some interesting, some strange, some cliche, some boring:

One interesting poem:

> My love is like <br>
> a spilled can of red paint
>
> I never know where to put it <br>
> or how to clean it up.

Here is the poetry box in action:

The poetry box now lives on my bookshelf, so if you come over to visit you're welcome to a free AI-generated poem.
