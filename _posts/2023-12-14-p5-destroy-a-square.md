I haven't tried doing any `p5.js` in this blog; today, I was in the mood to give it a try. Here is an old sketch I did for [genuary 2022](https://genuary.art/2022/prompts) for the prompt "Destroy a Square" which uses `p5` and `matter.js`:

<div id="sketch-holder"></div>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/p5.js/0.6.1/p5.min.js"></script>
<script language="javascript" type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/matter-js/0.18.0/matter.js"></script>
<script src="{{ base.url | prepend: site.url }}/assets/2023-12-14-p5-destroy-a-square/destroy_a_square.js"></script>
