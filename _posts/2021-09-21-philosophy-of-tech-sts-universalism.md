*I recently started taking a graduate course in the "Philosophy of Technology" at HKS. I wrote this reaction to the first course meeting.* 

While I have some meaningful background in analytic philosophy (mainly epistemology and philosophy of mind) at the undergraduate level, the philosophy of technology as a field is new to me, and it has been a while since I read / engaged with any sort of work that is properly in the style of analytic philosophy more broadly. Coming back to it -- both having been in the world and having broadened my intellectual lenses -- I am finding that it strikes me in a different kind of way. Where once I might have been excited by the grand ideas & big concepts, I am now struck more by its na√Øve tendency towards universalism and focus on conceptual analysis. 

The course starts out today, for example, with what feels like a classic philosophy-style definitional question, asking "what is technology?". Readings, students, and the professor offer some efforts towards an answer. One reading begins with an "instrumentalist" (or perhaps teleological) definition -- technology is a human creation to achieve some end: to make a task easier, quicker, more efficient; to solve a problem etc. The reading questions this type of definition, pointing out that technology is not only a *means* but also a structural thing that can determine / affect / distort our relation to the world. To put the point in sharp relief: technology is not just a means to an end, but also something that determines what ends we seek, how we understand these ends and so on. 

We discuss definitions in class as well, with the professor pushing classmates to clarify their definitional attempts -- this type of sharp conceptual analysis feels very characteristic of a philosophical approach to me. Classmates allude to the readings and offer their own intuitions: technology as tools; technology as an effort toward improving the world; and so on. One classmate memorably criticizes the other students' efforts, noting that their definitions are "value-laden", and instead offers a barren, "value-neutral" definitional effort. 

The professor closes the session with his own proposal at a grand definition -- a lengthy three-pronged thesis that technology includes some facets of "artefacts" (technologies are things, tools -- computers, cars etc.), "activities" (e.g. of organizing in certain ways, of operating said tools/artefacts), and "knowledge" (e.g. the theoretical knowledge of how to produce / execute  the tools/processes etc.). One student wisely questions: what human-touched thing can *not* be subsumed under so broad a definition? The professor responds ("natural trees"), but underscores that part of the purpose of the definitional discussion is to highlight that it is indeed difficult to provide a satisfactory definition of a concept like technology. 

As I read and listen to such discussions, I find myself contrasting this philosophy course with the starting point of the STS (science and technology studies) course I took this time last year. Where philosophy begins with an attempt towards a singular grand definition, STS begins from a far more constructivist standpoint. How does this STS stance address these types of definitional questions? It is a kind of sidestep move. Per Gallie, a big, abstract, value-laden (at least through its association to "progress") term like "technology" (like "art" or "science" or "justice") will surely be an "[essentially contested](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essentially_contested_concept)" one, doomed to be used by many but ever contested / disagreed upon in its uses, application & meaning. Given this, STS invites *not* to merely offer our own definition and so participate in this ongoing contest; instead, STS suggests that we step back and examine the contest itself as our object of study. What is the "[boundary work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary-work)" (Gieryn) involved in demarcating between "technology" and not? What norms, values, intuitions, imaginations, institutions are being recruited by definition-proposers in stabilizing their would-be boundaries between this "technology" and "non-technology"? What is "at stake" in this exercise of boundary-drawing, inventing technology and not? It might be an interesting exercise for another time to filter the class conversation through this lens. For now, I end here, simply acknowledging the substantial difference in "starting point" of these two disciplines.
