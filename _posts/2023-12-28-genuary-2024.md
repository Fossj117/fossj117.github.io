In this post, I will document the prompts that I complete for [genuary 2024](https://genuary.art/prompts). My plan for genuary is to take no more than 1 hour per sketch, and will share whatever I wind up with.

## January 1

**Prompt**: Particles, lots of them.

<div id="jan-1"></div>

<script src="{{ base.url | prepend: site.url }}/assets/2023-12-28-genuary-2024/jan1.js"></script>

I guess it's something like a galaxy?
