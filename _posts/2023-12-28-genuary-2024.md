This post will index my efforts for [Genuary 2024](https://genuary.art/). Check it out!

<!-- Liquid nonsense to build the ordered post list -->

{% assign post_list = site.posts %}
{% assign genuary_posts = "" | split: "" %}
{% for post in post_list %}
{% if post.tag contains 'genuary2024' %}
{% assign genuary_posts = genuary_posts | push: post %}
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}
{% assign sorted_genuary = genuary_posts | sort: 'genuaryDay' | reverse %}

<ul>
{% for post in sorted_genuary %}
<li>Day {{post.genuaryDay}} - <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
