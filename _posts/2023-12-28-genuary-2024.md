In this post, I will document my results for [genuary 2024](https://genuary.art/prompts). You can find the code for these sketches [here](https://github.com/Fossj117/fossj117.github.io/tree/master/assets/2023-12-28-genuary-2024).

## January 1 - "Particles, lots of them"

<div id="jan-1"></div>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/p5.js/0.6.1/p5.min.js"></script>
<script src="{{ base.url | prepend: site.url }}/assets/2023-12-28-genuary-2024/jan1.js"></script>

This turned out as something like a galaxy? (not necessarily my original intent) I was thinking today about the evocative power of simple bits of motion. I think I want to play with using movement and animation more.

## January 2 - "No palettes"

<!-- My concept for today involves some abstraction of bees and flowers to create procedural colors. -->

<!-- - Create a bunch of 'flowers' at random locations on the canvas with:
  - A given hue (in the HSB(A) sense)
  - A location on the canvas
  - A given lifetime
- Over a flower's lifetime, it grows in size until "death", when it "scatters" its seeds as new flowers in the same area.
- Create a bunch of "bees" at random locations on the canvas.
- Bees fly around randomly and "pollinate" flowers.
- This means that bees store the hue of the last flower they visited. When they visit the next flower, they "pollinate" it, meaning that they share with it the hue of the last flower it visited.
- When a flower "dies", it chooses the hues for its seeds based on some combination of its own hue, and the hue of the flowers that pollinated it.
- To get the hue of a seed:
  - Average your hue with a random pollinated hue
  - Add some random "mutations. -->

<div id="jan-2"></div>
<script src="{{ base.url | prepend: site.url }}/assets/2023-12-28-genuary-2024/jan2.js"></script>

(You can click the canvas to restart with a new base hue.)

## January 3 - "Droste Effect"

<div id="jan-3"></div>
<script src="{{ base.url | prepend: site.url }}/assets/2023-12-28-genuary-2024/jan3.js"></script>

My concept for today was to combine the recursiveness of the Drotse effect with a little bit of motion, continuing my theme. The idea was to make a rectangle bouncing inside a rectangle bouncing inside a rectangle and so on.However, after playing with the parameters a bit, I thought that this result was more interesting, even though it doesn't match the Droste effect prompt all that much.
