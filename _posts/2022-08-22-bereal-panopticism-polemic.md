I was joking around with some friends on BeReal, and started posting hyper-intellectualized takes in the comments of all my BeReals. One of these actually hit on something I found interesting. The basic point that I found interesting is the idea that the ability to curate what we post online may on the one hand make digital spaces feel more performative or constructed; but, on the other hand, it also plays this role of (i) limiting the view of tech platforms into our offline lives, and (ii) allowing (parts of) our offline lives to be "backstage" and therefore less performative and more authentic. 

BeReal, then, poses itself as a more "authentic" form of social media becuase it elimates online curation (to some extent). But a lack of online curation doesn't actually free us up to be more "authentic". In fact, quite the opposite: removing curation is tantamount to *getting rid of* that backstage space, instead forcing us to perform both online and off. 

There are lots of other intellectual references on these ideas such as Goffman (hence performative/backstage). I also always think of Dave Eggers' *The Circle* on this theme. Anyhow, the original take is written in a jokey polemical style, but I thought was worth preserving, so here it is: 

<blockquote>

BEREAL, AUTHENTICITY and PANOPTICISM

Through its name and branding, BEREAL poses itself as an AUTHENTIC digital space—in contrast with INAUTHENTIC social platforms of the past (Facebook, Instagram)—to the BENEFIT of users and platform alike.  

The logic is as follows. Through strict temporal constraints on posting, BEREAL excludes the possibility of user-driven CURATION. 

CURATION is posed as the central source of INAUTHENTICITY online. INAUTHENTICITY, in turn, is posed as harmful to both the user (for it psychological effects) and, indirectly, the platform (for how it limits the platform’s totalizing view of users’ commercial preferences). 

Is this logic correct? The answer, perhaps, is NO. 

Digital social platforms have long been likened to Bentham’s PANOPTICON, as analyzed by Foucault. However, with our present focus on CURATION, we see that this analogy has never (before) been apt. 

If Facebook is a PANOPTICON, it is one that comes equipped with window curtains that the prisoner may draw shut at will. The very antithesis of the idea! 

BEREAL, in fact, is the far closer analogue. Like Bentham’s prison guard, the platform may inspect at any moment, without prior notice to the user. 

We are lead to ask, then: are BEREAL’s limits on CURATION truly a boon to digital AUTHENTICITY? Let us consider the analogous question: are Bentham’s prisoners able to lead AUTHENTIC lives? Of course not. This is exactly the point. They are “free” and yet wholly controlled by their overseers’ totalizing gaze. 

And here we come to the heart of the matter. We must distinguish between AUTHENTICITY and ACCURACY of the digital portrait. 

BEREAL may indeed produce more ACCURATE digital portraits, which better match to offline existences. After all, CURATION is no longer allowed. 

But this ACCURACY will be achieved NOT by revealing our AUTHENTIC offline lives in digital space, but instead by forcing INAUTHENTICITY into all corners of our now ever-inspectable offline lives. 

Alas, the window curtains in our digital PANOPTICON have been removed, and so we must always be on our best behavior. 

This arrangement, of course, is a benefit to the PLATFORM who profits from ACCURACY and is indifferent to AUTHENTICITY, and yet still is harmful to the USER who truly seeks AUTHENTICITY and FREEDOM
