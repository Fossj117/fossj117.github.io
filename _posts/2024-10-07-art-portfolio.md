I have been thinking that I would like to pull together some of my creative technology art projects into a portfolio. Eventually, I will make this into something nicer and more-consistently presented. But for now, I just want to capture references to the different pieces I would like to include. 

#### Projects

- *Tree Portraits* (with Evan) - [Link](https://jeffreyfossett.com/2023/03/06/tree-portraits.html)

- *Hybridity* - [Link1](https://jeffreyfossett.com/2023/03/06/tree-portraits.html),  [Link2](https://jeffreyfossett.com/2024/09/22/axidraw-watercolor-dailies-part2.html), [Link3](https://jeffreyfossett.com/2024/09/29/axidraw-watercolor-dailies-part3.html). I need to extract some final piece from this exploration and pull out the conceptual thread I am most interested in. 

- *Loose Ends* - [Link](https://jeffreyfossett.com/2023/10/19/loose-ends.html)

- *AI Poetry Box* (with Evan) - [Link](https://jeffreyfossett.com/2022/10/05/ai-poetry-box.html). Need to flesh out concept and execution.
