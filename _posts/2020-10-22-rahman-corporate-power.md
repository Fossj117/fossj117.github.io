In this post, I want to share some rambling reactions to K. Sabeel Rahman's piece "[The New Octopus](https://logicmag.io/scale/the-new-octopus/)" in Logic Magazine. I read the piece as a participant in the 2020 [AMRI Academy](https://lpeproject.org/amri-academy/), and found it thought-provoking and articulate (as is much of Rahman's work). I don't claim that any of the points or arguments offered here are particularly decisive -- they are mainly just articulated ideas/questions/concerns that came up for me as I read the piece. 

The main point I want to mull over in this post is the idea that excessive corporate power could be *per se* problematic, regardless of whether it is exercised. This point seems important -- perhaps central -- in Law & Political Economy (LPE) thinking more broadly, and especially in how it differs from more conventional economic approaches. Here is a key articulation of the idea from Rahman (Rahman is here characterizing earlier legal thinkers like Brandeis; emphasis mine): 

> But what’s notable about the intellectual ferment around scale is the degree to which these debates *turned not on bigness*, but rather on issues of **power** and **contestability**. How much and what kinds of power did these new corporate entities exercise? And how could these concentrations of power be minimized, contested, and held accountable?
> 
> Power, crucially, could manifest in “good” and “bad” forms. Just because a firm acted benevolently did not change the fact that it possessed power. **The key, then, was not outcomes but potential: so long as the good effects of corporate power relied on the personal decisions of corporate leaders, rather than on institutionalized forms of accountability, it remained a threat**. 

In short, there is an idea here that the existence of corporate power *per se* could be a problem or "threat" worthy of regulatory response, regardless of whether or how that power is exerted, and regardless of the extent to which it comes with “bigness” in the sense of literal market concentration. On this framing, the key policy question, then, is how to create structures to ensure that such private power is (in Rahman’s framing) *contestable*, or accountable, or “in check”. 

While this position is (I think) clear to me, I am not sure if I fully understand the argument for adopting it. If concentrated corporate power per se is a threat--even if it is not exerted—-what exactly is it a threat to, and why exactly should we worry about it? The one-word answer seems to be that this power is a threat to “liberty”, or perhaps “democracy”. But these are broad terms that are hard to pin down. How are we to know when corporate power has become sufficient to threaten something so big as liberty? And what exactly is corporate power? 

In the article, Rahman taxonomizes key forms corporate power he sees in the modern technology sector, in particular naming: (1) transmission power, (2) gatekeeping power, and (3) scoring power. While I agree that some of the examples cited here are concerning, I am not sure if my reasons are the same as Rahman’s. And further, I am especially not sure if I see how they are examples of power that I understand as *per se* problematic (i.e. power that would be problematic *even if it were not exerted*). 

For example, Rahman cites Amazon’s ability to use its data to selectively enter and compete with successful third-party sellers as an example of problematic “transmission power”. I can understand how one could make an argument that this sort of behavior might be concerning from a narrower economic perspective e.g. by appealing to potential effects on innovation, but this does not seem to be Rahman’s argument. 

The innovation argument is something like the following: Amazon’s entry (or even *potential* entry) in downstream product markets could harm innovation incentives for sellers and reduce product quality or variety in the long run[^1]. But if Amazon never exerted this power (i.e. never entered third-party markets), and further had no incentive to do so, would we really still be concerned? I am not sure. Would our answer change if Amazon were (even) larger and more powerful than it is today, and a (even) larger share of commerce happened online? Maybe. I do understand the intuition — it’s threatening to have an economy or society that is too heavily dependent on the benevolence of some single actor, even if that actor is presently well-behaved. We recognize this in government and create checks and balances. With the election of Trump, we see why this is important. So too might we like to have checks on even well-behaved corporate power. 

Roughly, I think this fear of unchecked private power *is* the type of moral intuition that lies behind this perspective in general. While I do understand it, it also seems a strange thing when you peel the layers back. Is power that is never exerted really a relevant form of power? What if there is some other regulatory force -- like norms or economic forces -- that discourages the use of the power? Is regulatory policy or state action the only (acceptable) way to "check" concentrated private power? 

Further, even if we grant that checks on concentrated private power are *at some point* necessary in principle (even absent bad behavior), it’s not clear that we are anywhere near that point with Amazon, for example. And it’s a bit challenging to imagine how we would determine exactly that we were near such a point[^2]. Turning to such practicalities, an interesting comparison case to Amazon is Apple. It strikes me that Apple has substantial structural power through their control of iOS and so many of our devices. If we are to be suspect of Amazon, should we not also be suspect of Apple? Yet, Rahman and others in this conversation do not spend much focus on Apple with comparison to Amazon. Could this be because it is in fact Amazon’s *actions* rather than their *power* per se that we intuit as problematic?

Anyhow, if you are someone reading this post who knows more about these topics than I do, feel free to reach out and explain your perspective to me (`fossj117 AT gmail DOT com`). I don't claim to be an expert -- just someone trying to understand.

[^1]: I am not sure if this is compelling even as a narrow economic argument; but that is not really relevant to the discussion here. 

[^2]: Note that I reflected further about this practical set of questions [here](https://jeffreyfossett.com/2020/06/18/baker-political-antitrust.html) in response to Baker, who is coming from more of the conventional antitrust economist perspective. In that post, I argue essentially the opposite direction, so I am really not so sure where I stand on these themes.
