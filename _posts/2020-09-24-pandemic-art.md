Somewhere in the depths of the covid-19 pandemic, I started this project where I would cut up self-help books and make collaged found-poem type things out of them (sometimes with little illustrations). The initial idea was that I thought it would be funny to re-configure self-help books into dark and/or cynical poems. For example, here is one from _The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck_:

</p>

Here's one from _The Life Changing Art of Tidying Up_:

<img alt="Tidying" align="center" src="/figs/2020-09-24-pandemic-art/tidying.jpg" width="50%">
</center>
</p>

But I also made some nicer ones:

</center>
</p>

Anyhow, I still think that inverting self-help books is a funny idea, so maybe I will revisit that someday.
