The themes of the moment for me are *hybridity* and *(in)coherence*. 

In *A Cyborg Manifesto*, Donna Haraway takes the idea of the “cyborg” as a motivating metaphor.

Cyborgs are important for Haraway because they are *hybrids* that blend across the apparently strict boundary between “machine” and “organism”. 

Haraway invites us to consider and embrace a politics and sense of identity that is likewise willing to transcend or resist established binaries related to race, gender and so on:  

> What kind of politics could embrace partial, contradictory, *permanently unclosed* constructions of personal and collective selves and still be faithful, effective -- and, ironically, socialist-feminist. 

Haraway’s discussion is rich and multifaceted — political, philosophical, and critical. But what I want to focus on today is the *emotional* dimension of Haraway’s work. 

At the outset of the piece, Haraway describes the essay as “an argument for *pleasure* in the confusion of boundaries”. Later, she explains that: 

> …a cyborg world might be about lived social and bodily realities in which people are *not afraid* of their joint kinship with animals and machines, *not afraid* of *permanently partial identities and contradictory standpoints*

These terms like "pleasure" and "fear" are *emotional* words. They are feelings and ways of experiencing the world.

It is natural to bring up these emotional words, because it can *feel* profoundly *uncomfortable* to exist on the boundary of identities, or in a state of apparent contradiction or incoherence (at least in the eyes of the world). 

I know that others experience this far more profoundly than I do, as someone who fits within many expected boxes.

But this is also a kind of discomfort that I can relate to in parts of my life, as I struggle on the boundaries of different academic/intellectual/creative/personal perspectives which often feel mutually inconsistent, or at least difficult to reconcile. 

Plenty of the intellectual world places a high value on internal consistency. Isn't that *what it means* to be a "good", thoughtful, intellectual thinker? To be someone who works out all the inconsistencies, makes sense of things, and acts accordingly? I think of the [Socratic interlocutors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_dialogue) with their [unexamined beliefs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_unexamined_life_is_not_worth_living), *made better* by careful inducements to reason more deeply and carefully. I think of Descartes and his will to [doubt all things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_doubt) that can possibly be doubted. Philosophy education teaches that (intellectual) inconsistency is a state to be avoided and resolved in the process of learning and self-improvement.

But so, returning to Haraway, part of the idea is to recalibrate the *emotional* experience of "hybridity" and "contradiction". The point is not just to tolerate or even accept these states as *inevitable-but-undersirable* (and ideally *transitory*) states of a complex world that often resists reason and reconciliation. 

Instead, Haraway invites us to go even further; how might it feel to *embrace* and *celebrate* these states of apparent contradiction, hybridity, and *both-ness* as worthy and permanent states of being? How might it feel to stand happily in hybridity, with full acceptance and sense of arrival and integrity? 

Of course, sometimes integration and reconciliation can also be worthy goals. Sometimes, sensibilities that seem in conflict are, in fact, *not in conflict at all* if looked at from the right angle. But the point is that integration need be a precondition for arrival and celebration.

Anyway, thanks for reading and, as always, let me know if you have thoughts on any of this. 

<!-- Someone commented on the Tik Tok video I made about my [pen plotter / watercolor process](https://jeffreyfossett.com/2024/09/06/axidraw-watercolor-dailies.html) using the term "cyborg art", which I relate to. This inspired me to go back and re-read Haraway's [*A Cyborg Manifesto*](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/english/currentstudents/undergraduate/modules/fictionnownarrativemediaandtheoryinthe21stcentury/manifestly_haraway_----_a_cyborg_manifesto_science_technology_and_socialist-feminism_in_the_....pdf) which I think about a lot. 

I was certainly thinking about Haraway's work when making these watercolor drawings; I have also been thinking about her cyborg metaphor more broadly as I try to find my own intellectual and life path on the boundaries of different worlds. 

Notes from Haraway: 

> A cyborg is a cybernetic organism, a hybrid of machine and organism, a creature of social reality as well as a creature of fiction. 

> I am making an argument for the cyborg as a fiction mapping our social and bodily reality and as an imaginative resource suggesting some very fruitful couplings. 

> By the late twentieth century, our time, a mythic time, we are all chimeras, theorized and fabricated hybrids of machine and organism--in short, cyborgs. The cyborg is our ontology; it gives us our politics. 

>  In the tradi-tions of  “Western” science and politics—the tradition of  racist,male-dominant capitalism; the tradition of  progress; the tradi-tion of  the appropriation of  nature as resource for the produc-tions of  culture; the tradition of  reproduction of  the self  fromthe  reflections  of   the  other—the  relation  between  organism and  machine  has  been  a  border  war.

> This essay is an argument for *pleasure* in the confusion of boundaries and for *responsibility* in their construction. 

Three crucial boundary breakdowns: 

* Human and animal. "Nothing really convincingly settles the separation of human and animal"
* Animal-human (organism) and machine
* Boundary between physical and nonphysical

> From another perspective, a cyborg world might be about lived social and bodilyrealities in which people are not afraid of  their joint kinship withanimals and machines, not afraid of  permanently partial iden-tities and contradictory standpoints. The political struggle is tosee  from  both  perspectives  at  once  because each reveals  bothdominations   and   possibilities   unimaginable   from   the   othervantage point. Single vision produces worse illusions than dou-ble vision or many-headed monsters. Cyborg unities are mon-strous and illegitimate; in our present political circumstances,we could hardly hope for more potent myths for resistance andrecoupling. 

> What kind of politics could embrace partial, contridictory, permanently unclosed constructions of personal and colelctive selves and still be faithful, effective -- and, ironically, socialist-feminist. 

There are a number of different things going on in the Haraway piece, and I would encourage reading it in full. It's immensely complex and rich -- one of these pieces you could read 10 times and unpack something new each time. 

But what are some of the basic ideas?

However, the piece that sticks with me is the idea of embracing the cyborg metaphor. 

Why is Haraway interested in the cyborg? Well, for Haraway, the cyborg is a fundamentally *hybrid* entity, it resists collapse across 

> A cyborg is a cybernetic organism, a hybrid of machine and organism, a creature of social reality as well as a creature of fiction. 

For various reasons, Haraway thinks that this is a useful metaphor to understand and reimagine various aspects of modern life and politics. She asks: 

> What kind of politics could embrace partial, contridictory, permanently unclosed constructions of personal and collective selves and still be faithful, effective -- and, ironically, socialist-feminist? 

> I am making an argument for the cyborg as a fiction mapping our social and bodily reality and as an imaginative resource suggesting some very fruitful couplings.

Hi Friends,  -->

The themes of the moment for me are *hybridity* and *(in)coherence*. 

In *A Cyborg Manifesto*, Donna Haraway takes the idea of the “cyborg” as a motivating metaphor.

Cyborgs are important for Haraway because they are *hybrids* that blend across the apparently strict boundary between “machine” and “organism”. 

Haraway invites us to consider and embrace a politics and sense of identity that is likewise willing to transcend or resist established binaries related to race, gender and so on:  

> What kind of politics could embrace partial, contradictory, *permanently unclosed* constructions of personal and collective selves and still be faithful, effective -- and, ironically, socialist-feminist. 

Haraway’s discussion is rich and multifaceted — political, philosophical, and critical. 

But what I want to focus on today is the *emotional* dimension of Haraway’s work. 

At the outset of the piece, Haraway describes the essay is “an argument for *pleasure* in the confusion of boundaries”. Later, she explains that: 

> …a cyborg world might be about lived social and bodily realities in which people are *not afraid* of their joint kinship with animals and machines, *not afraid* of *permanently partial identities and contradictory standpoints*

These terms like pleasure and fear are *emotional* words. They are feelings and ways of experiencing the world.

And it is natural to bring up these emotional words, because it can *feel* profoundly *uncomfortable* to exist on the boundary of identities, or in a state of apparent contradiction or incoherence (at least in the eyes of the world). 

I know that others experience this far more profoundly than I do. 

But this is also a kind of discomfort that I can relate to in parts of my life, as I struggle on the boundaries of different academic/intellectual/creative/personal perspectives which often feel mutually inconsistent (or at least difficult to reconcile). 

Plenty of the intellectual world places a high value on internal consistency. Isn't that *what it means* to be a "good", thoughtful, intellectual thinker? To be someone who works out all the inconsistencies, makes sense of things, and acts accordingly? I think of the Socratic interlocutors with their unexamined beliefs, made better by careful inducements of the Socratic hero to reason more deeply and carefully. I think of Descartes and his will to doubt all things that can possibly be doubted. Intellectual inconsistency is a state to be avoided and resolved in the process of learning and self-improvement.

But so, returning to Haraway, part of the idea is to explore recalibrating the *emotional* experience of hybridity and contradiction. And the idea is not just to tolerate or even accept these states as *inevitable-but-undersirable* (and ideally *transitory*) states of a complex world that often resists reason and reconciliation. 

Instead, Haraway invites us to go even further; how might it feel to *embrace* and *celebrate* these states of contradiction and hybridity as worthy and permanent states of being? How might it feel to stand happily in "contradiction" or hybridity, with full acceptance and sense of arrival and integrity? 

Of course, integration and reconciliation can also be worth goals. Sometimes, sensibilities that seem in conflict are, in fact, *not* if looked at from the right angle. But the point is that integration need be a precondition for arrival and celebration.

emotional idea is not just to allow or accept or tolerate hybridity and contradiction, but rather to 

Haraway invites: 



For me, I think that a lot of this connects to ideas about "integrity" too. What does it look like 

As someone who comes from a very intellectualized background, there's an idea that to have intellectual integrity is to make sense of things, to make things coherent, to be internally consistent, well-reasoned. 

-- 






to imagine how it would feel to not reject or even just temporarily *tolerate*, but rather to *embrace* and *celebrate* these states of hybridity, contradiction, both-ness (h/t patcon for this last word) as worthy and permanent states of being.

Not just tolerate as temporary states which are yet-to-be-resolved into one thing or the other. 







, with integrity. 

I have been engaging more with drag culture in the past few years thanks to my partner, Elspeth. 

I am a straight guy and a beginner in understanding the world of drag, so I am wary to make any comments here. 

However, I will allow myself to express my own experience with exploring drag -- which is to say that I think that part of what makes drag feel so powerful and liberatory as an emotional experience--even for me as a straight guy--is that it's a creative celebration of boundary crossing, 

(That's why I think that things like drag story hours are powerful too, to introduce youngsters to the idea that you can resist being a certain way the world expects)


More notes: 

> The permanent partiality of  feminist points of  view

> We do not need a totality in order to workwell. The feminist dream of  a common language, like all dreamsfor a perfectly true language, of  perfectly faithful naming of  ex-perience,  is  a  totalizing  and  imperialist  one.

> we  can  learn  from  our  fusions  withanimals and machines how not to be Man, the embodiment ofWestern  logos.  From  the  point  of   view  of   pleasure  in  these potent  and  taboo  fusions,  made  inevitable  by  the  social  rela-tions of  science and technology, there might indeed be a femi-nist science.

> But  there  are  also  great  riches  for  feminists  in  explic-itly  embracing  the  possibilities  inherent  in  the  breakdown  of clean  distinctions  between  organism  and  machine  and  similar distinctions structuring the Western self. It is the simultaneity of breakdowns  that  cracks  the  matrices  of   domination  andopens geometric possibilities. What might be learned from per-sonal  and  political  “technological”  pollution?  

> Cyborg writing must not be aboutthe Fall, the imagination of  a once-upon-a-time wholeness be-fore  language,  before  writing,  before  Man.  Cyborg  writing  isabout  the  power  to  survive,  not  on  the  basis  of   original  inno-cence, but on the basis of  seizing the tools to mark the world thatmarked them as other.The  tools  are  often  stories,  retold  stories,  versions  that  re-verse anddisplace  the  hierarchical  dualisms  of   naturalizedidentities. In retelling origin stories, cyborg authors subvert thecentral  myths  of   origin  of  Western culture.  We  have  all  beencolonized by those origin myths, with their longing for fulfill-ment  in  apocalypse.  The  phallogocentric  origin  stories  mostcrucial for  feminist  cyborgs  are  built  into  the  literal  tech...




I was speaking with Patcon the other day, and this helped me recognize the connection here with anarchist thought. Not just a tolerance, but an embrace of the messiness and improvisation of political
