## January 24

I picked up some sprouts to grow in a mason jar. I've done this before a while ago, but thought I'd give it another go. I am going to start by soaking one heaping tablespoon of sprouts in a few inches of water for most of today. I am adding them in this morning at 7:30am, so they should soak until mid-afternoon sometime, perhaps. After that, seems that I just need to rinse them twice a day.
