My concept for today was to combine the recursiveness of the Drotse effect with a little bit of motion. The idea was to make a rectangle bouncing inside a rectangle bouncing inside a rectangle and so on. However, after playing with the parameters a bit, I thought that this result was more interesting, though it doesn't match the Droste effect prompt all that much.
