Today I don't have much time, but here's a little experiment. Keep watching for some phases.

Maybe there's a spirtual connection in this design to the transient, emergent, Deweyan publics I was just taking notes on [over here]({{ base.url | prepend: site.url }}/2023/12/27/notes-on-plurality-book.html#section-4). I would like to do something more directly connected to that metaphor in the future.
