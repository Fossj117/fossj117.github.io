I am interested in getting more involved in the [Plurality](https://www.plurality.institute/) research space. In this post, I am going to brainstorm and outline a few hypotheses I have currently about how I might contribute and what I find interesting. 

**Direction 1: empirical quantitative research**. Especially connected to experiments in the crypto space e.g. around public funding (QV/QF?), governance (DAOs) etc. Why is this a useful direction? 
* There is already strong leadership on two fronts: 
    * Technical, engineer-type folks (from the crypto side) -- how do you implement these things etc. What is technically possible? 
    * Theoretical thinking about these problems -- e.g. economists, conceptual thinkers; people like Glen Weyl, Vitalik and others. Market design, systems. 
* There seems to be comparatively less quantitative empirical research about these topics. Some brainstorms on empirical questions: 
    * What is the impact of different sorts of DAO governance models? What are some of the challenges? I know [Kishore](https://kishorevasan.github.io/) is interested in some questions here (I don't want to scoop any of his research ideas, but this is an interesting direction!). 
    * What are the effects of shifting to QV or QF models? I think some claims here e.g. in *Radical Markets*, 
    * Do current public funding efforts fund the right things? 
        * What is the effect of these funding efforts? I think [Open Source Observer](https://www.opensource.observer/) is interested in some of this.
* Despite this, there is a preponderance of data available at least in principle.
    * Most important information is recorded on-chain. 
    * Data aggregators that maintain relevant ETL: [Flipside](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/), [Dune](https://dune.com/). 
    * [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) and subgraph tools. 
    * Archive nodes.
    * [DAO Voting Data](https://github.com/kishorevasan/voting_games) is possible. 
* There also seem to be lots of (natural) experiments, policy changes etc. that could be sites of study. 
* In short, it seems like there is both a gap and potential here which I could contribute to as someone with training in quantitative social science research. 

**Direction 2: plural data science; plural knowledge creation**: This direction is more challenging to articulated, but is discussed a bit [here](https://jeffreyfossett.com/2023/10/25/brainstorm-on-plurality-and-quant-social-science.html) and in my comments on the plurality book [here](https://jeffreyfossett.com/2023/12/27/notes-on-plurality-book.html#section-3).
* A good reference is the [*Data Feminism*](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/) book, as well as lots of STS work, including from Sheila Jasanoff (see e.g. [my notes on coproduction](https://jeffreyfossett.com/2021/09/21/notes-on-coproduction.html), [digital forms of public reason](https://jeffreyfossett.com/2020/02/20/sts-public-reason.html) and also [Ezrahi](https://www.amazon.com/Descent-Icarus-Transformation-Contemporary-Democracy/dp/067419828X)). 
* In short, I've been surprised a bit that in the plurality space there is not more of a constructivist perspective with respect to social scientific knowledge creation, and an interest in building more democratic, pluralistic modes of social scientific knowledge-making.
* Questions: 
    * Whose knowledge, whose ways of knowing count as "fact"? "Epistemic violence" discussed in *Data Feminism* book. 
    * What sorts of tools would support more transparency and plurality in the processes of knowledge creation? One reference: Airbnb's [knowledge repo](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/scaling-knowledge-at-airbnb-875d73eff091). Another reference: [CAT Lab](https://citizensandtech.org/about-cat-lab/). 
    * The role of experts; c.f. Dewey's articulation (referenced in notes [here](https://jeffreyfossett.com/2023/12/27/notes-on-plurality-book.html#section-4)), technocratic models, others.
* Concrete idea: the knowledge repo for public interest data science and quantitative research (maybe initially focused in the blockchain space). Something I've thought about for a long time (and pitched at Berkman previously). Benefits: 
    * Full transparency about knowledge creation processes and logics. 
    * Public and open peer review process that can intervene at all levels of the knowledge-creation process. Maybe a special say or need for approval from those who are directly affected by the knowledge claim?
    * Governance e.g. with [Gov4Git](https://github.com/gov4git/gov4git). Other models?
    * Could benefit also data journalists and other borderline academic work; other public interest data work about the internet. 
    * Arguable improvements over the academic review process -- on the internet, especially in the web3 space, can more readily have full transparency over the data generation process. E.g. here are the exact queries for this public database like Flipside which is ETL on top of this other public database (the Ethereum blockchain). 

More idiosyncratic ideas that I have been thinking about here: 

* Comparative study of the technology of public engagement processes in the US vs. in Taiwan. 
    * Compare e.g. regulation of Uber, use of polis etc. with FCC comment process around net neutrality and various shenanigans. 
* In general, tracing more connections between plurality space and STS. 
    * Better peeling apart of "plural technologies" idea and technological solutionism (draft in process). 
    * Sociotechnical imaginaries as a useful theoretical term (noted [here](https://jeffreyfossett.com/2023/12/27/notes-on-plurality-book.html#section-1)). 

Perhaps I will keep adding to this list as I continue thinking. If you are reading this and have thoughts or want to collaborate, feel free to email me at `fossj117 AT gmail DOT com`.
