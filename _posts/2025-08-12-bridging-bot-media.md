For the past ~year, I have been working with [Plurality Institute](https://www.plurality.institute/) on a project about LLMs and conflict mediation in online conversations. There's a lot to say about this project from a lot of different perspectives. For now, I am just going to start this post to capture some early media on the project. 

First, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgfXdJ-7pF4&ab_channel=PluralityInstitute) is a link to a presentation I gave at the [LLMs in Public Discourse](https://www.plurality.institute/blog-posts/exploring-opportunities-for-large-language-models-in-public-discourse) conference:

This presentation also led to some nice coverage from the Council on Tech and Social Cohesion [here](https://techandsocialcohesion.substack.com/p/from-battleground-to-common-ground).
