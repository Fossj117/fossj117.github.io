In this post, I will document my current bike build, and keep notes on future changes I am considering. I'll add to this post as I make changes or research more things.

## Current Build 

Here is a picture of my current build:

## Component Considerations

Listing components etc. that I find potentially interesting or want to learn more about. Or other questions that I want to investigate further. 

### Framesets

* [Soma Rush](https://www.somafab.com/archives/product/rush)
* Various NJS frames. (Need to learn more -- NJS export? custom?)  
* There are some [Mash framesets](https://shop.mashsf.com/) I like. 
* [Cinelli supercorsa pista](https://usa.cinelli-milano.com/collections/supercorsa-pista/products/supercorsa-pista-frame-set). Way expensive, but really like the classic feel.

In general, want to learn more about the details of different geometries. How much variation is there? What are the tradeoffs? Similarly, want to learn more about different types of steels, different types of lugs. How perceptible are these differences, really?

### Cranks

In general, should/will probably upgrade to something 144 bcd soon.

* Sugino 75 - standard. Worth? [e.g.](https://wabicycles.com/products/sugino-75-crankset-48t-1-8-165-170mm-w-bb-black)

I am wondering how much difference I will notice with nicer BB / cranks etc. My main priorities here are ride feel and durability. 

### Chainring

* [Aarn](https://shop.44rn.com/category/144bcd-track-chainrings) -- seems like these are a bit trendy, but the look is cool for sure and build quality seems good. 

## Notes on Changes 

* 4/30/24 -- put on new wheelset & tires (Archetypes + DT Swiss hubs + GP5000 28s). Changing a few things at a time here but generally happy with it. I think the biggest thing is probably moving from 23s to 28s which definitely seems to affect ride feel on bumpier surfaces etc.
