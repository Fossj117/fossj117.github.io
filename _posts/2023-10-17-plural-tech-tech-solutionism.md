## Polis and Plural Technologies

Over the past few days, I have been reading about the tool [Polis](https://compdemocracy.org/Polis/) from the [Computational Democracy Project](https://compdemocracy.org/). Per the linked site, Polis is described in the following way:

> a real-time system for gathering, analyzing and understanding what large groups of people think in their own words, enabled by advanced statistics and machine learning

The site goes on later:

> In its highest ambition, Polis is a platform for enabling collective intelligence in human societies and fostering mutual understanding at scale in the tradition of nonviolent communication.

You can read more about Polis on [their site](https://compdemocracy.org/Polis/); the list of [case studies](https://compdemocracy.org/Case-studies/) was most helpful for me in understanding how the tool works and what it is used for. There is also an interesting [recent application](https://www.anthropic.com/index/collective-constitutional-ai-aligning-a-language-model-with-public-input) of Polis by the [Collective Intelligence Project](https://cip.org/) and [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/) to solicit public feedback on AI goverance.

I initially learned about Polis via the [Plurality Institute](https://www.plurality.institute/), which cites Polis as an example of a broader category they call "plural technologies". In [the mission statement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R8BYn47a1yfqXwk2LSplBUChhEZQSgL92xKfV5pMXsk/edit), plural technologies are characterized in the following way:

> Plural technologies are broadly reusable computational systems emergent from a diversity of systems of thought that facilitate the flourishing of and cooperation across a dynamic diversity of accountable and fluid social groups. They affirm that the purpose of technology is to amplify the power and value of human cognitive diversity, not resolve it into singularity.

## Is a focus on plural technologies an example of "technological solutionism"? What is technological solutionism?

In learning about the Polis project--and the idea of plural technologies more generally--I find that I have competing intellectual intuitions (which I would like to make better sense of in the remainder of this post).

On the one hand, these projects are very interesting and exciting to me for a range of reasons. Among other things, in my orbit of the technology goverance, I see plenty of interest generally about "democratizing" technological development processes, and comparatively less clarity about what exactly that means in practice. Against this backdrop, a project like [this one](https://www.anthropic.com/index/collective-constitutional-ai-aligning-a-language-model-with-public-input) leveraging Polis (also referenced above) seems like a worthy step forward. Likewise for Audrey Tang's work with [vTaiwan](info.vtaiwan.tw).

However, on the other hand, when I read the visions for Polis and plural technologies more broadly, it's hard not to have my "technological solutionism" alarm bells go off: "advancing technological solutions to big social problems like 'democracy' or 'cooperation'? uh oh!" The question I would like to start to answer (for myself) in this post: are these alarm bells warranted? What exactly _is_ the issue with "technological solutionism"? (To what extent) do I think is this a useful critique in the first place? And if it is a useful critique, does it apply to the plurality space?

In my understanding, the term "technological solutionism" was mainly popularized by Evgeny Morozov in _To Save Everything, Click Here_ (2013), and has been around -- and fairly ubiquitous[^1] -- in the digital tech criticism zeitgeist ever since. What is tech solutionism? Here is a nice summary from [an interview](https://www.publicbooks.org/the-folly-of-technological-solutionism-an-interview-with-evgeny-morozov/) with Morozov:

> [*technological solutionism* is] an endemic ideology that recasts complex social phenomena like politics, public health, education, and law enforcement as “neatly defined problems with definite, computable solutions or as transparent and self-evident processes that can be easily optimized—if only the right algorithms are in place!”

Likewise, here is another definitional effort from [a recent slate article](https://slate.com/technology/2023/03/chatgpt-artificial-intelligence-solutionism-hype.html) criticizing AI hype:

> technological solutionism is the mistaken belief that we can make great progress on alleviating complex dilemmas, if not remedy them entirely, by reducing their core issues to simpler engineering problems

So what is the problem with tech solutionism (both as it is understood by Morozov and subsequent critical tech discourse)? Or what are technology critics hoping to convey when they apply this term to a project or claim? I am not going to do systematic review here (and so I might be missing things), but a few main themes jump to mind for me.

First, and most basically, critics think tech solutionism is naive and wrong as a predictive factual matter, at least in its most extreme form. In other words, if you think that your mobile app or AI tool is going to "solve big social problem X" with a snap of the fingers...you're probably just wrong.

Second (but related to the previous), I think there is a concern that tech solutionism can crowd out focus on what critics then view as more "real" or robust pathways to solutions -- social, legal, policy reform etc. Hype around new, flashy technological solutions can suck up all the energy and/or capital, depsite the fact that they are unlikely to really solve the problem (per above). This point basically explains why "technological solutionism" actually has negative consequences for the world, according to critics. If it was just a mistaken belief (with no other consequences), maybe it would not be such a cause for concern. 

Third and finally, I think that a lot of critical distaste for tech solutionism is tied up with criticism of how it gets deployed in capitalistic technological development. In short -- in many cases, purveyors of technological solutions are not _really_ interested in solving the social problem they purport to be solving. Instead, they are interested in making (or raising) a bunch of money, and the social problem is serving as a kind of moral wrapping paper and/or marketing. Hence, the critic's purpose in applying the "technological solutionism" label is partly to highlight this misdirection. This third point fits in with the previous two because its a theory of why they arise -- i.e. purveyors of technological solutions are often advancing naive visions of social impact *becuase* they actually are focused on advancing private commerical ends rather than substantiating public ones. Broad social benefit marketing is nonetheless valuable for securing funding, and also for securing labor, since workers like to feel like they are making a positive impact[^2]. 

Fourth: Zach's point about "legitimacy" and who is in the room around technological decisions. In particular: if this technology is supposed to address social problem X -- who's vision of (or viewpoint on) this social problem is being advanced as needing solving? Who gets to define the problem and how? 
* Relatedly: who is building this vs. who is it claiming to be for? Who has input into the design of this system and how? e.g. open source vs. closed source, democratic input vs. N white guys in SF
* From a practical perspective: who will actually have access to (and be able to benefit from) this solution? Is this solution really for "everyone" or is it really just for you builders and people like you? 
   * (E.g. I think this is a huge issue in web3 space)

## Where I was trying to go with this

That's the end of my (informally) articulated thoughts. Where was I hoping to go with this? What questions am I trying to address?

* If you look at the plurality / polis mission statements, they do "sound like" technological solutionism on their face in some ways. How does the plurality movement / world / discipline evade this trap of technological solutionism? 
* I guess I think that the plurality world *is* evading or can evade this trap, but I'd like to better articulate for myself how and why. Or alternatively if I don't think that this supposed trap *is* a trap, I'd like to articulate why I believe *that* is the case. 

* Beginnings of what I think is my preferred resolution here: 
   * While technology critic class is often critical of technology offered as naive solution to social problems, there's also a deep acknowledgement e.g. in STS (and also other fields) that [technology is political](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20024652); it has social consequences. [Technology is itself a mode of governance](https://jeffreyfossett.com/2023/10/18/my-lens-on-technology.html) -- it makes certain ways of being in the world easier, and other ways of being in the world harder. 
   * From this viewpoint, it clearly *is* the case that intervening in the direction of (and imaginaries around) technological development is an important site of politics. 
      * And maybe that's part of what's different? Plurality is really about articulating/advancing a sociotechnical imaginary vs. a particular naive technical solution as the be-all end-all? 
         * The latter would be in tension with the basic idea of plurality -- i.e. it's not about finding "the" singular solution. Recall  from the vision statement:
         > They (plural technologies) affirm that the purpose of technology is to _amplify the power and value of human cognitive diversity, not resolve it into singularity_.
      * Lessig [pathetic dot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathetic_dot_theory) also an inspiration here. 
   * What other ways are plural technologies different? Some ideas: 
      * Most focal examples are not for-profit / privately funded. Public, open-source, transparent. 
      * Social/political embeddedness; engagement with communities -- for example, Polis is not just a tool that imagines it will solve these problems by itself, it is a tool that positions itself in tight connection with democratic systems -- e.g. in Taiwan.  
         * Awareness that it's not just about the technology; but that technology (can have) a role to play in conjunction with other social/political/institutional forces.
         * Relation to [Ezrahi](https://www.amazon.com/Descent-Icarus-Transformation-Contemporary-Democracy/dp/067419828X). 
      * Broader intellectual grounding in economics, political theory, philosophy etc. 
   * Other thoughts? 
      * Some related ideas [here](https://jeffreyfossett.com/2023/10/25/brainstorm-on-plurality-and-quant-social-science.html) about plurality and social science in particular.

[^1]: I think "technological solutionism" is up there as far as critical buzz phrases over the past ten years or so, alongside other big ones like "surveillance capitalism", "algorithmic bias"

[^2]: Your tech firm's "mission" or claimed social benefit is a kind of job-specific "amenity" in the language of economists.
