I impulse bought a Pocket Operator "Arcade" (aka the [PO-22](https://teenage.engineering/store/po-20/)) on [Facebook Marketplace](https://mailchi.mp/76f2b5e944c1/jeffs-bloglife-update-may-13-19039) (and later a PO-33) and have been making some silly tunes. The Arcade is a super simple little synthesizer and sequencer with a handful of chiptune arcade-y type sounds built in. It's limited, but is really easy and fun to experiment with for that reason. Anyways, I like documenting things, so below are some of the tunes I've made[^1]. 

Tunes made with the Arcade:

After playing with the arcade for a while, a [PO-33](https://teenage.engineering/store/po-33/) showed up on Marketplace too and I couldn't resist grabbing it. The PO-33 has a built in sampler with a mic which makes it a lot more powerful in principle. Here are a few efforts so far.

This one has a little sample from [Oh, Maker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyux-sEdlbg); I'm fiddling with the live "effects" in the recording:

This one has a sample from a street performer playing flute in Harvard square:

I'll probably add to this list as I keep experimenting.
