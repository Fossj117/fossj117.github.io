A few weeks ago, I picked up a Bridgestone MB-6 on Facebook marketplace. It had been rescued from the back of someone's garage (I think) and restored by Joe at [Mead street cycles](https://www.instagram.com/mead.st.cycles/) and was in good shape. I liked the colorway and was looking for a new bike in this genre for commuting and grocery-getting, and so I decided to make the purchase. 

Here is a pic of how it was set up when I got it:

After some research, my best guess is that this frame is [from 1992](https://www.sheldonbrown.com/bridgestone/1992/1992.pdf):

Though it was in good shape to start out with, I wanted to make some changes for some combination of reasons -- some practical, some aesthetic, some just for fun. I've been working on [my fixed gear](https://jeffreyfossett.com/2024/04/29/bike-build.html), and so the Bridgestone presented a chance to learn about a new set of things -- rear casettes, derailleurs & shifting systems; threaded headsets & quill stems; cantilever brakes. Here is where the build is currently:

A log of some changes I've made so far, and some notes about the processes/reasonings: 

* My first change was to swap out the stem, since the reach was a little long for me. I picked one up at [Broadway Bicycle](https://broadwaybicycleschool.com/) and tried polishing it up with some sandpaper and then Mothers polish, which worked fairly well. I had to re-rig the front brake with a brake hanger. Cantilver brakes are tricky, but are also growing on me for a few reasons. First, there's an aesthetic appeal of the tensioned cabling. Second, it's cool that they are so tuneable. I believe it's the original stock brakes that are still on the frame, so that's a nice piece of tradition as well; though maybe I will swap them out with something nicer eventually. 
* I polished up the cranks and seat post, both of which I think are the originals. The latter was pretty scuffed up, but cleaned up pretty well. 
* I swapped out the chainring and pedals mainly for aesthetic reasons, since I like silver components. The pedals are MKS sylvan pedals, which I like so far. Incidentally, it seems that the nicer MB frames came with similar MKS pedals back in the 90s. 
* I put on a Brooks C17 which I got for cheap on FB marketplace. 
* I put on some fancier silver brake levers mainly for aesthetics; this was a good chance to learn about setting up cantilever brakes. 
* I put on some silver swept-back bars for comfort and vibes. This is a casual, comfortable kind of set up.
* A slightly bigger change for me is that I converted the setup to friction shifting with the [Silver](https://www.rivbike.com/products/kjalgjoihjga44451?srsltid=AfmBOoroCnd-F-E7k_GPKOkp3abwhqYKsl0cudGH9nvPBVPMqEnJnPui) shifters from Rivendell. I haven't run friction before, but it seemed like a good fit for this build for a number of reasons. I like it a lot so far. As you may know, there's a connection between 90s Bridgestone and Rivendell via Grant Petersen, who is also an advocate of friction shifting. In the same 1992 Bridgestone catalogue displayed above, there's a whole write-up about friction shifting, which I am sympathetic to. Hopefully I will write more about this at some point, but in general I think that friction shifting is a nice example of a more general set of tradeoffs around "abstraction" in technological development.

</div>

It's funny to see that friction shifting was being called obsolete and archaic as far back as 1987, approximately 40 years ago. I guess it all depends on what your priorities are.

I've left the wheelset on for now, though I might upgrade it eventually. Based on the specs from the Bridgestone catalogue, I think it's the original wheelset from Araya. I think they could use some trueing. I am taking a wheel-building class at Broadway Bicycle, so maybe I'll try to build a new wheelset myself if I can. I'll perhaps change up the tires too at some point. 

Anyhow, for now I am enjoying the bike in look and feel, and have learned a fair bit from experimenting with it.

For future reference, here's the full set of original specs from the Bridgestone catalogue:
