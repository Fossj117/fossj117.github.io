I am a data scientist and [doctoral student](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=1068421) in the Technology and Operations Management group at Harvard Business School. Primarily, I'm interested in using empirical methods to study economic and policy questions related to technology platforms and online marketplaces. 

Previously, I was a member of the [data science team at Airbnb](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/at-airbnb-data-science-belongs-everywhere-917250c6beba), received my [AM in Statistics at Harvard University](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/alumni), and my BA in Mathematics and Philosophy from [Williams College](https://www.williams.edu/).
