I am a data scientist and [doctoral student](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=1068421) in the Technology and Operations Management group at Harvard Business School. My research interests are at the intersection of technology, economics, and policy. 

Previously, I was a member of the [data science team at Airbnb](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/at-airbnb-data-science-belongs-everywhere-917250c6beba), received my [AM in Statistics at Harvard University](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/alumni), and my BA in Mathematics and Philosophy from [Williams College](https://www.williams.edu/).
