I am a data scientist currently pursuing an [AM in Statistics at Harvard](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/pages/graduate-statistics-general-information). Previously, I was a member of the data science team at [Airbnb](http://airbnb.com), and received my BA in math and philosophy from [Williams College](https://www.williams.edu/). 

My interests include: technology, internet, & data ethics and policy; politics; causal inference; matching markets; natural language processing; the sharing economy.
