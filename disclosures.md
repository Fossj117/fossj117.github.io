I am currently a paid employee of [Plurality Institute](https://www.plurality.institute/), where I have benefited from grant funding from [Google.org](https://www.google.org/), and have partnered with [Google Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.google/). In this capacity, I have also benefited from funding from Schmidt Philanthropies, the John Templeton Foundation, and Cosmos Institute.

I was previously an employee of [Airbnb Inc](https://www.airbnb.com/) and have a significant financial interest in the company.
