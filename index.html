<p>Currently, I am a <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=1068421"> doctoral student</a> in the
    Technology and Operations Management group at Harvard Business School and a <a
        href=https://www.plurality.institute/about>research lead</a> at Plurality Institute. My research interests are in the economics and
    governance of digital technologies. </p>
<p>Previously, I was a member of the <a
        href="https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/at-airbnb-data-science-belongs-everywhere-917250c6beba">data science
        team at Airbnb</a>, received my <a href="https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/alumni"> AM in Statistics at Harvard
        University</a>, my BA in Mathematics and Philosophy from <a href="https://www.williams.edu/">Williams
        College</a>, and studied at <a href="https://exeter.williams.edu/">Oxford University</a>. I have also been
    affiliated with the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/">Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society</a> both as
    research intern and as an <a href="https://www.bkmla.org/">Assembly Student Fellow</a>. You can find a copy of my CV
    <a href="/files/Jeffrey_Fossett_CV_2023.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to reseach, I enjoy creative projects, especially <a href="https://90percentart.com/">at the intersection
        of technology & visual art</a>. See the <a href="https://jeffreyfossett.com/posts/">posts</a> section of this
    site for (mostly) informal writing & experimentation on a range of topics.</p>
