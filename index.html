<p>Currently, I am a <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=1068421"> doctoral student</a> in the Technology and Operations Management group at Harvard Business School. My research interests are at the intersection of digital technology, economics, STS, and public policy. In addition to reseach, I also enjoy creative projects, especially <a href ="https://90percentart.com/">at the intersection of technology & visual art</a>.</p>
<p>Previously, I was a member of the <a href="https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/at-airbnb-data-science-belongs-everywhere-917250c6beba">data science team at Airbnb</a>, received my <a href="https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/alumni"> AM in Statistics at Harvard University</a>, my BA in Mathematics and Philosophy from <a href="https://www.williams.edu/">Williams College</a>, and studied at <a href="https://exeter.williams.edu/">Oxford University</a>. I have also been affiliated with the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/">Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society</a> both as Research Intern and as an <a href="https://www.bkmla.org/">Assembly Student Fellow</a>. You can find a copy of my CV <a href="/files/Jeffrey_Fossett_CV_2023.pdf">here</a>.</p>
