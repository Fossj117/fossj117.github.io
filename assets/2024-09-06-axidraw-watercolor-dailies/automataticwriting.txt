Sanders was the first of his kind and he never knew what it meant to him but there he found himself in front of the gate to all of it. it was large and opaque but he could seem to tell what was behind. After much consideration he slowly reached out a hand to grasp the large brittle doorhandle. I seemed to crumble under his touch, but held firm enough to turn. And so he did and there it was before him. The door cracked open to reveal it not all at once but slowly, creaking as its old hinges turned. Was it what he had expected? Not exactly, but at least he had found it. It had been a great long search and Sanders was tired.
