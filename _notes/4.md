I like this bit from the plurality network mission statement: 

> Plural technologies are broadly reusable computational systems emergent from a diversity of systems of thought that facilitate the flourishing of and cooperation across a dynamic diversity of accountable and fluid social groups. They affirm that the purpose of technology is to amplify the power and value of human cognitive diversity, not resolve it into singularity.  They instantiate pluralism both epistemically in their approach to understanding and institutionally in the structure of the technologies themselves.
