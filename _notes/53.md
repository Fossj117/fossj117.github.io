<div class="poem">
Mary Oliver says that the Sun slides on heavenly oils,<br>
but to me that sounds like a kernel of pop corn<br>
sliding around in the bottom of my stovetop pan 'til finally<br>
"pop! pow!"<br>
it emerges, pushing insides out, in airy deep release.<br>
Did you know that, one day, the sun will pop too,<br>
"pow! pop!"<br>
like a pop corn kernel, expelling out its insides too, in<br>
a nova suprise of dust and energy?<br>
God will wait for other star pops too,<br>
here and there around the Universe<br>
until the popping speeds up and finally slows. She will wait a<br>
millenium, maybe two. That's nothing much to Her.<br>
She'll gather the pop stars into a bowl then, topping<br>
With the salt of cosmic dust, or a few cracks of moon pepper.<br>
She will pour golden butter from the Big Dipper and then<br>
Shake it all around. They call it the Big Crunch,<br>
but really it's just a kind of shake up so that everyting is<br>
evenly dispersed.<br>
Things will be ready then, and she'll settle in to watch<br>
Her favorite show.

I was thinking a bit about [this](https://poets.org/poem/dover-bitch) poem from Hecht which responds to [Dover Beach](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43588/dover-beach).*
