```
Mary Oliver says that the Sun slides on heavenly oils, 

but to me that sounds like a kernel of pop corn

sliding around in the bottom of my stovetop pan 'til finally 

"pop! pow!" 

it emerges, pushing insides out, in airy deep release.

Did you know that, one day, the sun will pop too, 

"pow! pop!"

like a pop corn kernel, expelling out its insides too, in

a nova suprise of dust and energy? 

God will wait for other star pops too, 

here and there around the Universe

until the popping speeds up and finally slows. She will wait a

millenia, maybe two. That's nothing much to Her. 

She'll gather the pop stars into a bowl then, topping

With the salt of cosmic dust, or a few cracks of moon pepper. 

She will pour golden butter from the Big Dipper and then 

Shake it all around. They call it the Big Crunch, 

but really it's just a kind of shake up so that everyting is

evenly dispersed. 

Things will be ready then, and she'll settle in to watch

Her favorite show.

Generated based on a prompt that involved reading Mary Oliver's [The Sun](https://readalittlepoetry.com/2025/09/10/the-sun-by-mary-oliver/) at [this](https://www.stillifestudios.com/events/q-review-generative) workshop. I was thinking a bit about [this](https://poets.org/poem/dover-bitch) poem from Hecht which responds to [Dover Beach](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43588/dover-beach).
