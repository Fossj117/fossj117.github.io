Notes on [*Cloud*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_(film)):  
* **Director**: Kiyoshi Kurosawa
* **Watch date**: 1/31/26
* **Rating**: 6.7/10  

**Notes**: 

* Not sure how to process this movie exactly. 
* In general, was more funny than I was expecting. Saw at the Brattle, and there was a fair bit of laughter from folks in the audience. It's not exactly dark humor, more like laughing at the absurdity of the situation, and often their kind of over-the-top or ridiculuous aspects. 
* Characters are pretty flat and sometimes stylized; did not really feel like you are meant to relate to them. They consistently respond to the situations presented in natural ways. Mostly under-reacting to things?
* On writing this, I think what sticks out is the combination of the narrative and characters having these ridiculous, over-the-top elements -- e.g. the assistant, the former boss who both have ridiculous arcs -- with the flatness of the tone otherwise. It's kind of like deadpan humor.
