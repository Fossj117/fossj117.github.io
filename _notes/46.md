There is a way in which mending or repairing something that already exists demands a much deeper sort of attention than making something new. 

When you make something new, you don't have to pay attention to, or contend with, what is already there in the same way. You can control everything, start from scratch, make it "perfect" or just the way you want or imagine.

But when you repair something, you have to be adaptable, responsive. Of course, first you have to notice the need for the repair. But then also you have to figure out how to respond to the need. I guess in some cases this could be straightforward. But at least with clothing, it often requires some thought. What sort of repair will work well here? What should I use to do it? Should I sew it by machine or by hand? Do I care about the aesthetics of this or something more practical?

With mending, you have to contend with the reality of the thing as it already is, and the damage that's already been done. That's different from being able to sweep the slate clean and start from scratch. The latter can have challenges too, but they're different ones...
