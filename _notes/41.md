## Maintenance Session Logs

I started going to [these](https://themaintainers.org/monthly-maintenance-sessions/) monthly "maintenance sessions" organized by The Maintainers. In this post I keep some notes on these sessions. 

### September 2025

Today, I worked on cleaning my kitchen; my biggest move was bringing a table down to the storage unit, moving some other unusued things into storage areas. 

Someone mentioned *Maintainamorphosis* -- A portmanteau of 'maintain' and 'metamorphosis' mantainamorphosis denotes the simultaneous preservation and innovation of an item or idea. From Virgil Abloh. 

I thought about the distinction between "shallow" and "deep" cleaning/maintenance. L. reframed as it being a point about considering the "systems" of maintenance which I agreed with -- proceeding within the existing systems/infrastructures that have been set up vs. engaging in the "system-level" work of revising the infrastructure, setting up new systems etc. 

I think there is also something about maintenance work that *can* be systematized vs. maintenance work that cannot. Ongoing, predictable, repeatable tasks vs. more infrequent, one-off problems to be solved. The latter often requires a bit more thought and work. It's also not always the same as "setting up a better system". 

For example, in the last session, I'd spent a bunch of time shredding unhelpful junk mail type stuff from my financial accounts. After that, I was prompted to figure out how to actually go in and change my settings in the account to "paperless" so that they will actually stop sending me the junk. This required some work because I was actually not able to do it myself and had to email the admin and re-set up my account and then finally I could change it. So this is kind of like a "systemic" fix to a maintenance task, but it's also not quite the same as "setting up a better ongoing system of maintenance". It's more like "addressing the root cause". 

We talked a bit more about joyful vs. laborious maintenance. 

A. talked about maintenance and class; the privilege of disposability; throwing things away as a class signifier.

### August 2025

I went to a monthly "maintenance session" organized by the Maintainers today. It was a really lovely a friendly space full of people who are interested to think more about maintenance and repair. 

As I was going off to do my maintenance tasks, I was thinking about how some maintenance tasks are enjoyable for me, while others are not so much. 

For example, I love riding my bike and I enjoy the process of cleaning and maintaining my bike. 

It's like the perfect maintenance task -- the bike gets covered very superficially in bits of dirt and gunk when I ride in the forest. This dirt is easy to clean off with a bit of water or solution, and the reward is a beautiful bike, that again looks and feels good to ride. 

Repairing clothes is also a maintenance task that is kind of fun and satisfying. It's grounding and also rewarding. 

But other sorts of maintenance tasks are not so fun or rewarding. They are easier to avoid, less satisfying. The example I was focused on today was cleaning out a pile of junk mail on my desk. This involves a bunch of shredding and sorting through a big mess of things. My shredder is not very good and so it's slow and always overheating and getting jammed. 

And so the question I was thinking about generally is: 

* Why are some sorts of repair and maintenance tasks more fun and rewarding than others? 
* How much does this have to do with the tasks themselves, vs. other features of our relation to them? 
    * E.g. the infrastructure of maintenace -- the tools, routines, systems, that we have to do the cleaning or repair. My bike cleaners and brushes; my bike stand. Vs. my inconvenient scanner. 
    * Attitudes towards these tasks and what they mean or signify is also surely part of it.
    * How might I reorient myself and my systems to make it easier e.g. to handle this unpleasant junk mail maintenance task? What is the scope for agency there?
