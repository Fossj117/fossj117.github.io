I got this old map of Cambridge. I want to do some sort of project with it. Here is my current idea: 

1. Yous scan a tag or QR code. 
2. You get sent to a site with the map of cambridge. 
3. It asks you if you want to share your location. 
4. If you do, it shows where you are currently on the map. 
5. You can also share a current photo of the place you are in [maybe, not sure about this step]

Other ideas are that I want to personally do this kind of investigation in a series. I went over the "Gallows hill" location near me recently.
