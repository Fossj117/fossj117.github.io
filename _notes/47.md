Notes on [*Weapons*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapons_(2025_film)):  
* **Director**: Zach Cregger
* **Watch date**: 11/6/25
* **Rating**: 7/10  

**Notes**: 

* Tension-building in first half was pretty good. However the clown-vibe jump scares make me eyeroll and break tension in a way that I don't find compelling. 
* Decent acting; I'm a fan of Julia Garner.
* Salient storytelling choice to do the "retelling same timeline from multiple different perspectives sequentially" thing. I guess I find it interesting, though also annoying sometimes. Incidentally also just watched *House of Dynamite* which has a similar form. I think the form is most interesting when repeated moments are deeply reinterpreted when retold from new perspective; otherwise, can just feel redundant. 
* Movie tone definitely changes a lot in back half; at moments it almost becomes dark humor/slapstick. E.g. when kids are chasing Gladys and then gleefully tearing her apart. 
* Some commentary I saw interprets the film as a school shooting allegory, which I hadn't considered. I do think it was a compelling choice to start the narrative after the disappearance, and focus so much of it on the community's efforts to process this in both considered and mis-guided ways. Likewise, I liked the choice to center Garner's character (and her being scapegoated) at the outset as a lens into this. 
* Maybe I will watch *Barbarian* next (also Cregger) to see how that is.
