A hypothesis for life and work: 

* Pretty much any task can be pleasurable, rewarding, enjoyable, if you are willing to do it slowly, mindfully, with curiosity and intention. 
* Pretty much any topic can be interesting if you are willing to explore it slowly, mindfully, with curioisity and intention.
