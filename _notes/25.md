An underrated way to defend the value of constructivist analysis of knowledge-making processes is that it's *useful* and *illuminating* regardless of whether you believe it's the "correct" or "deepest" critical account of things. Constructivist approaches are useful because they attune you to a very different set of things that are going on in the making and affirming of knowledge and what it is doing in the world etc. Relatedly, I think it is largely possible to be a constructivist analytically without disbelieving in the truth or accuracy of knowledge claims.
