I think that one of the best arguments for constructivist analysis of knowledge-making processes (strong program in sociology of knowledge etc.) is not that it is the "correct" or "deepest" critical account of things. Instead, can just argue that it's just a useful/illuminating way of looking at things, because it attunes you to a very different things that are going on in the making and affirming of knowledge and what it is doing in the world etc. Relatedly, I think it seems perfectly possible to be a constructivist analytically without disbelieving in the truth or accuracy of knowledge claims.
