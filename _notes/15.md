I see them around a lot and want to learn more about them.

Some questions: 

**How many turkeys are there?**

There's a group that roams together near me a lot I think. Today, October 20, 2024, I counted eight turkeys at the corner of Mass ave and Linnnean. I see them at that patch of grass a lot. 

According to [this source](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/learn-about-turkeys), turkeys live in flocks, so this must be a flock: 

> Wild turkeys live in flocks organized by “pecking order.” Each bird is dominant over or “pecks on” birds of lesser social status. Turkeys may attempt to dominate or attack people that they view as subordinates. This behavior is observed most often during breeding season. Once bold behavior is established, it can be very difficult to change.

**What do turkeys eat?**

> Wild turkeys seasonally exploit a diversity of food items, including plant material, seeds, nuts, berries, insects, and invertebrates. In the fall, they feed on acorns, beech nuts, hickory nuts, and seeds. In the winter, turkeys avoid areas with deep, fluffy snow. During the summer, turkey poults rely on insects that are extremely protein rich, which enables the small poults to grow and mature quickly. Turkeys scratch the ground searching for food.

**How do I tell a male from a female turkey?** 

Here is one explainer: [link](https://www.wikihow.com/Sex-Turkeys). 

Here is another: [link](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/identifying-female-and-male-turkeys-in-the-spring). 

**What's that fleshy thing on their beak?**

It's a [snood](https://www.petturkeys.com/Turkey-Snood.html). [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey_(bird)#Anatomy) is the wikipedia.

> In anatomical terms, a snood is an erectile, fleshy protuberance on the forehead of turkeys. Most of the time when the turkey is in a relaxed state, the snood is pale and 2–3 cm long. However, when the male begins strutting (the courtship display), the snood engorges with blood, becomes redder and elongates several centimeters, hanging well below the beak

What is its purpose? According to wikipedia: 

> The snood functions in both intersexual and intrasexual selection. Captive female wild turkeys prefer to mate with long-snooded males, and during dyadic interactions, male turkeys defer to males with relatively longer snoods

**What are some things that turkeys do?**

[Preening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preening): 

> Preening is a maintenance behaviour found in birds that involves the use of the beak to position feathers, interlock feather barbules that have become separated, clean plumage, and keep ectoparasites in check

> Feathers contribute significantly to a bird's insulation, waterproofing and aerodynamic flight, and so are vital to its survival. Because of this, birds spend considerable time each day maintaining their feathers, primarily through preening.

Dusting: 

>  In dusting, turkeys get low on their stomach or side and flap their wings, coating themselves with dirt. This action serves to remove debris build-up on the feathers and also clog tiny pores that parasites such as lice can inhabit

Sunning: 

> Sunning for turkeys involves bathing in the sunlight, for their top and bottom halves. This can serve to liquidate the oil that turkeys naturally produce, spreading over their feathers and dry their feathers from precipitation at the same time.

**What kind of turkeys live in Cambridge?**

Wild turkeys are *Meleagris gallopavo*. There are six subspecies according to wikipedia: 

M. g. silvestris (Vieillot, 1817)
M. g. osceola (Scott, 1890)
M. g. intermedia (Sennett, 1879)
M. g. merriami (Nelson, 1900)
M. g. mexicana (Gould, 1856)
M. g. gallopavo (Linnaeus, 1758)

I am not sure which subspecies lives in Cambridge, but [it seems most likely](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Historic-distribution-of-North-American-wild-turkey-subspecies-Meleagris-gallopavo-and_fig1_322541990) to be *Meleagris gallopavo silvestris* or the Eastern wild turkey. 

Some [notes on identification](https://wildlife.tamu.edu/wildlifemanagement/eastern-wild-turkey/): 

> Hens may occasionally have beards, although this uncommon event produces much shorter beards than toms. Both toms and hens have sparsely feathered heads with bare legs and feet that are pink to red in color. Toms grow a spur on the lower third of their leg that starts off small and rounded, but which becomes pointed and about 2 inches long with time.

**What do you do with an aggressive turkey?**

> His best advice for people who come into contact with an aggressive turkey is “stand your ground.” The birds want to attack from behind with their wings, beak, or bony spurs in their legs. People should keep the turkey in front of them and make loud noises or use an object like a broom or umbrella to create the impression that the turkey is under threat.
