I see them around a lot and want to learn more about them.

Some questions: 

**How many turkeys are there?**

There's a group that roams together near me a lot I think. Today, October 20, 2024, I counted eight turkeys at the corner of Mass ave and Linnnean. I see them at that patch of grass a lot. 

According to [this source](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/learn-about-turkeys), turkeys live in flocks, so this must be a flock: 

> Wild turkeys live in flocks organized by “pecking order.” Each bird is dominant over or “pecks on” birds of lesser social status. Turkeys may attempt to dominate or attack people that they view as subordinates. This behavior is observed most often during breeding season. Once bold behavior is established, it can be very difficult to change.

Interestingly, I found out [here](https://www.nwtf.org/content-hub/wild-turkey-lifestyle-and-breeding) that there are separate male and female hierarchies and that "Stable pecking orders within flocks of the same sex seem to be common to all wild turkeys subspecies."

I discussed this with M who said that a group of turkeys can also be called a "gang" which is funny and apt. [This](https://www.usgs.gov/news/featured-story/wild-turkey-talk#:~:text=A%20group%20of%20turkeys%20is,noble%20fowl%20of%20American%20tradition.) source suggests that "rafter" is also an accepted term. [Here](https://animals.howstuffworks.com/birds/what-is-a-group-of-turkeys-called.htm) is another reference on turkey group names which claims the following:  

> A group of turkeys is officially called a rafter. This term dates back to at least the 16th century, though today it often gets replaced by the more generic "flock."

> Still, "rafter" is the established term recorded in dictionaries and used in avian studies.

> While "rafter" might sound like something you'd find in a barn, it's actually linked to older uses of the word meaning an arrangement or grouping. That makes it a good fit for these birds, whether wild or domesticated.

This usage of "rafter" does seem to be quite old, and is not included in [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rafter), for example (though [Dictionary.com has it](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/rafter)).

**What do turkeys eat?**

> Wild turkeys seasonally exploit a diversity of food items, including plant material, seeds, nuts, berries, insects, and invertebrates. In the fall, they feed on acorns, beech nuts, hickory nuts, and seeds. In the winter, turkeys avoid areas with deep, fluffy snow. During the summer, turkey poults rely on insects that are extremely protein rich, which enables the small poults to grow and mature quickly. Turkeys scratch the ground searching for food.

**How do I tell a male from a female turkey?** 

Here is one explainer: [link](https://www.wikihow.com/Sex-Turkeys). 

Here is another: [link](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/identifying-female-and-male-turkeys-in-the-spring). 

A male turkey adult is a gobbler or a tom. A female turkey adult is a hen. A juvenile male turkey is a jake. A juvenile female turkey is a jenny ([source](https://dnr.maryland.gov/wildlife/documents/all-about-the-wildturkey.pdf)). 

**What's that fleshy thing on their beak?**

It's a [snood](https://www.petturkeys.com/Turkey-Snood.html). [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey_(bird)#Anatomy) is the wikipedia.

> In anatomical terms, a snood is an erectile, fleshy protuberance on the forehead of turkeys. Most of the time when the turkey is in a relaxed state, the snood is pale and 2–3 cm long. However, when the male begins strutting (the courtship display), the snood engorges with blood, becomes redder and elongates several centimeters, hanging well below the beak

What is its purpose? According to wikipedia: 

> The snood functions in both intersexual and intrasexual selection. Captive female wild turkeys prefer to mate with long-snooded males, and during dyadic interactions, male turkeys defer to males with relatively longer snoods

**What are some things that turkeys do?**

[Preening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preening): 

> Preening is a maintenance behaviour found in birds that involves the use of the beak to position feathers, interlock feather barbules that have become separated, clean plumage, and keep ectoparasites in check

> Feathers contribute significantly to a bird's insulation, waterproofing and aerodynamic flight, and so are vital to its survival. Because of this, birds spend considerable time each day maintaining their feathers, primarily through preening.

Dusting: 

>  In dusting, turkeys get low on their stomach or side and flap their wings, coating themselves with dirt. This action serves to remove debris build-up on the feathers and also clog tiny pores that parasites such as lice can inhabit

Sunning: 

> Sunning for turkeys involves bathing in the sunlight, for their top and bottom halves. This can serve to liquidate the oil that turkeys naturally produce, spreading over their feathers and dry their feathers from precipitation at the same time.

[Strutting](https://www.nwtf.org/content-hub/why-the-strut):

> “Strutting is an instinctive or innate behavior,” Eriksen said. “The word is used to describe the courtship display of the wild turkey.”

> The displays range from ornate to simple, and all are designed to allow the male to show off his plumage and colors in hopes of suitably impressing a female to result in mating.

> Folks generally associate strutting with the mating season, but the same display has other meanings in different situations.

> “Outside of the breeding season, strutting is often used as a show of dominance when performed in the presence of other males,” Eriksen said. “Optimistic gobblers also may perform the display in the presence of hens outside the breeding season in the vain hope of stimulating a breeding session.”

I sometimes see the Cambridge turkeys strutting. Here are a few of the males strutting near the road at like 7am (Oct 27 2025):

Flying: wild turkeys can fly.

Roosting: wild turkeys usually fly up into trees to roost in the night to avoid nocturnal predators. They have bad nocturnal eyesight. 

**What's the deal with "mating season"?**

According to [this](https://www.nwtf.org/content-hub/wild-turkey-lifestyle-and-breeding) link the breeding season for Eastern Wild Turkey is: 

> Breeding usually begins in late February or early March in its southernmost habitats, but not until April in northern states. The cycle is complete with the hatching of poults by June or as late as mid-summer farther north. Birds that renest may bring off broods as late as August.

**What kind of turkeys live in Cambridge?**

Wild turkeys are *Meleagris gallopavo*. There are six subspecies according to wikipedia: 

1. M. g. silvestris (Vieillot, 1817)
2. M. g. osceola (Scott, 1890)
3. M. g. intermedia (Sennett, 1879)
4. M. g. merriami (Nelson, 1900)
5. M. g. mexicana (Gould, 1856)
6. M. g. gallopavo (Linnaeus, 1758)

I am not sure which subspecies lives in Cambridge, but [it seems most likely](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Historic-distribution-of-North-American-wild-turkey-subspecies-Meleagris-gallopavo-and_fig1_322541990) to be *Meleagris gallopavo silvestris* or the Eastern wild turkey. 

Some [notes on identification](https://wildlife.tamu.edu/wildlifemanagement/eastern-wild-turkey/): 

> Hens may occasionally have beards, although this uncommon event produces much shorter beards than toms. Both toms and hens have sparsely feathered heads with bare legs and feet that are pink to red in color. Toms grow a spur on the lower third of their leg that starts off small and rounded, but which becomes pointed and about 2 inches long with time.

**What do you do with an aggressive turkey?**

> His best advice for people who come into contact with an aggressive turkey is “stand your ground.” The birds want to attack from behind with their wings, beak, or bony spurs in their legs. People should keep the turkey in front of them and make loud noises or use an object like a broom or umbrella to create the impression that the turkey is under threat.

**Where did the turkeys come from?**

I was discussing the turkeys with M and she told me that the turkeys around here originally came from the Adirondack area in New York State. There is more info about this history [here](https://www.audubon.org/news/how-wild-turkeys-took-over-new-england). 

One quote: 

> Just 50 years ago, the Wild Turkey population in New England was essentially non-existent, and had been for over a century. Then, an extensive, coordinated effort to trap and transfer turkeys across state lines rejuvenated the population—a comeback lauded by wildlife biologists and agencies as a conservation triumph

Essentially, by the 1850s there were very few Wild Turkeys left in New England due to people cutting down forests where the turkeys lived, and limitations to their food supply. 

The reintroduction of the turkey was a conservation effort. The article describes that in the 70s "Massachusetts captured 37 Wild Turkeys from New York’s Adirondacks in the 1970s and released them in the Berkshires." By then, people had mostly moved into cities, and turkey predators were limited, so the population "exploded". Apparently there are now some 25,000 wild turkeys in Massachusetts, "almost all of which descended from those few dozen relocated birds". 

**WINTER UPDATE: What do turkeys do in the winter**

December 15, 2025. 

I saw the turkeys today out in the snow. It's below 20 degrees Farenheit today which is pretty chilly. What do the turkeys do in the winter? How do they survive?

There is some info [here](https://www.nwtf.org/content-hub/how-turkeys-survive-winter-with-a-boost-from-conservation) from the National Wild Turkey Federation. Some notes: 

* They build fat reserves in the warmer months to help them survive so they don't need to eat as much. 
* When it gets cold, they don't move around as much to conserve energy. 
* Their feathers help them stay warm. They can fluff up the feathers to trap air against skin for additional insulation. 

There is another article [here](https://www.nwtf.org/content-hub/the-dynamics-of-winter-turkey-flocks). This seems to suggest wild turkeys form bigger flocks in the winter. The article also notes: 

* Turkeys will also seek out denser vegetation for shelter in the winter, helping them withstand the harsh winter conditions
* They rely more on hard masts like acorns, crops, seeds and other plant materials in the winter. In general turkeys [have a flexible diet](https://www.mossyoak.com/our-obsession/blogs/turkey/wild-turkeys-in-winter-where-do-they-go), so they are pretty adaptable in what they eat, and can vary across seasons. 

According to [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_turkey#Flight) they shelter in Conifer trees when the weather is bad.
