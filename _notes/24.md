I think that one of the best arguments for engaging interdisciplinarily is the sense of epistemic humility that it can cultivate. This can be useful and pragmatically relevant even if it doesn't affect your own preferred epistemic frame. 

I.e. even if I don't modify my own sense of how to understand the world, there can be value in deeply internalizing the sense that I could be totally wrong.
