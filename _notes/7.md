I am interested in thinking about science as a practice of care. Science and measurement as curiosity and careful attention, or ways of observing things. Science as continuous with art. Science before it became such a site of power and a way of controlling the world. Science as a way of looking at things closely. 

Darwin on the Beagle, carefully observing finches, making notes and drawings. Curie experimenting. Da Vinci blending art and science etc. 

I worry that a lot of critical analysis of science willfully obscures these sensibilities. Instead, you get: science as power; science as control; science as violently forcing things into comprehensible boxes; science as continuous with brittle hierarchical management. 

That's not to say that these critiques are not useful or valid in many situations. But I'm curious what are some other ways of seeing?
