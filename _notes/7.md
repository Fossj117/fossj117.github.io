I am interested in thinking about science as a practice of care. Science and measurement as curiosity, careful attention. Science as continuous with art.

Science before it became such a site of power and a way of controlling the world. 

Darwin on the Beagle, taking notes about finches. Curie experimenting. Da Vinci blending art and science.
