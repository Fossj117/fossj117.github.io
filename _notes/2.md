A few nice quotes from [*in praise of uselessness*](https://www.avabear.xyz/p/in-praise-of-uselessness): 

> To pursue the useless thing, as I understand it, is to pursue the thing that is compelling only to you, not obviously remunerative, limited in scope.

And later:

> The heart of uselessness, I think, is love [...] the kind that can’t be shown off as evidence that you’re worthy, [and] can’t be converted into goodwill

The idea that what is "useless" to the world but still interesting to me = exactly the set of things that make me myself. 

It identifies the unique aspect of "my values" at least as they are felt.
