I am interested in questions about expertise and technocracy, and the relation between various sorts of "expert" judgement and democratic decision-making. I was at a conference today and there was a nice provocation/framing on this theme. 

The idea is that technocracy is a question about *what is the basis upon which* individuals get to have a say about a particular public problem which affects them.

Say I believe something that an expert or expert community believes to be untrue. Or I have a belief or argument that I am not able to rationally defend.

Do I still get to have a say about the decision being made? Is my perspective worthy of consideration and deserving of space in the democratic or deliberative process? How and to what extent?

This is perhaps obvious, but can be difficult to keep in mind, particularly for educated experts who have deeply assimilated the idea that some perspectives are right while others are wrong, some beliefs are true while others are false etc.

From a constructivist perspective, fact-making always involves taking issues off the table of democratic deliberation. I think this framing of "*what is the basis upon which* individuals get to have a say" is nice because it raises some of the same concerns in a way that feels more legible to a non-constructivist expert.
