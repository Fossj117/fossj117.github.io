An unfortunate feature of the modern digital environment: extreme customization & personalization, but no personal control. 

- Hyper customization / personalization / curation that is done _for me_ in digital spaces. My feeds, my recommendations etc. are all super tailored to "my interests". 
- But fundamentally a deep lack of control over my digital life; inability to personalize _for myself_. I cannot reconfigure how my digital spaces looks, how they operate, what they priortize etc.
