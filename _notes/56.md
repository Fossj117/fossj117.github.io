Some notes on applique variants.

## Reverse Applique

Here is [one video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hd9QSquEn4) on reverse applique. Some notes: 

* Baste. 
* Trace pattern.
* Cut out pattern from top fabric but leaving a little space from edge of pattern. 
* She then folds the raw edge under and pins. Cuts slits to facilitate folding under where needed. 
* Stitch near the folded under edge. 
* Result is pretty clean. 

She recommends nothing "too complicated" or small in the design.

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHQ2x4i_0Nc) is another video. She does a version by hand with an embroidery hoop. Steps: 

1. Join reverse fabric to stabilizer
2. Hoop the garment with stabilized reverse fabric behind and trace design on front.
3. Hand stitch around edge of design with a back stitch.
4. Cut out interior inside of back stitched design.
5. Then she reinforced with machine sewing. 

This approach leaves an unfinished edge on the inside of the design from the top fabric. 

Here[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8x0l5HLeqKM] is another video. 

She is using woven blankets with designs as the reverse fabric.

Steps:

1. Cuts out shape from reverse fabric. 
2. Serges the raw edges of the cut out.
3. Pins serged reverse piece to back side of final garment. 
4. Sew around edge from inside of garment w/ straight stitch. She uses normal foot, but could use darning foot. She stitches into a bunch of the smaller aspects of the design. Basically depends what you want final shape to look like.

Also leaves unfinished edge on the outside.
