* **Director**: Kiyoshi Kurosawa
* **Cinematographer**: Tokush√¥ Kikumura
* **Watch date**: 7/18/25
* **Rating**: 8.1/10  

**Notes** (very quick): 

* I thought this was pretty intriguing film. Character of Mamiya in particular is interesting and well done. 
* I think need to re-watch to understand better, or read about. I missed a bit of the crucial final scene. 
* Use of sound was memorable for me. A lot of drone sounds, the laundry running. Sharp changes in sound. 
* Fairly slow pacing. Dark.
