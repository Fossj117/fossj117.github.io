In Heath's *The Benefits of Cooperation*, I am very interested in how he centers "self-binding" as a key mode of cooperation. 

Self-binding basically means "self control" or what an economist might think of as overcoming behavioral biases: scrolling too long on my phone, being susceptible to distraction, caving to other vices etc.

It's easy and common to individualize these kinds of things: these are problems for the individual to solve with discipline and self-control. 

While I think there is certainly value in discipline, it's interesting to center the interpersonal and cooperative approaches to addressing these problems: a key way we can help each other is to offer accountability, to encourage each other to be the versions of ourselves that we most want to be. 

> Our ability to enlist others to help us maintain self-control has been cited as one of the most important advantages of cooperation.
