Notes on [*Snowpiercer*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowpiercer)  
* **Director**: Bong Joon Ho
* **Watch date**: 5/5/25  
* **Rating**: 6/10  

**Brief Notes**: 

* Reminded me a lot of *Silo* which I watched not too long ago. I think both are based on books, so I'm not sure which is the direction of influence. 
* More stylized than I was expecting; reminded me a bit of *Mad Max* in the stylization of the violence. Or maybe Tarantino? 
* Acting and writing I thought was meh; didn't love Chris Evans in it, or find him particularly believable. 
* The overall conceit (all of humanity on this one train that runs for ever) is a bit meh as well, and doesn't feel particularly coherent in terms of the backstory of how we got here. We start with this as mystery at the start, but don't have many important things clarified by the end. Why a train? How did Wilford know that the geoengineering wouldn't work? How are the tracks maintained? Maybe that's beside the point, but
* Thought it should have ended before the revelation of whether it's possible to survive outside. Pose the clear moral question more clearly: is it worth it to risk destroying an unjust world?
