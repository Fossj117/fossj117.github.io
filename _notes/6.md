I like lots of things from [100 rabbits](https://100r.co/). A nice excerpt from their mission statement: 

> We want our work to be an equal blend of aesthetics, playfulness, and practicality. A well-written and functional software is necessary, but an attention to beauty and play enriches a project, creates a sense of culture, and more importantly it motivates us to pursue deeper, more meaningful lives in a world designed to dispossess and distract us.

Another bit I like from [here](https://100r.co/site/computing_and_sustainability.html) on the value of simplicity and building from comprehensible basics: 

> There is this myth that we're building on the shoulders of giants, but when you're all the way up there on the giant's shoulders, it is really hard to steer
