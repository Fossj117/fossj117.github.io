Some purchase research notes from a morning of distraction. I guess I am mostly thinking about bike ride purchases and accessories, and I pulled off of my intended tasks this morning to explore a bunch of bits and bobs. 

### Bike Camera 

I am thinking about a compact camera that I can take on my bike.

The main options I found are: 

* Ricoh GR -- the options are the GR III and GR IIIx. The main difference here is the focal length (28mm vs. 40mm), which is a matter of preference. 40mm is more pulled in, which can be "easier" and has more bokeh which is nice. It's less good for capturing landscapes and things though. The 28 is more similar to an iPhone camera I think. It can be cropped down though. Either could be good. 
* Fuji X100V - well regarded but discontinued and hard to find? So probably not on the table for now. [One review from Bike Breath](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCw7xO9m9UM). 
* Sony RX100.

### Bike Computer 

I want a very simple bike computer with a GPS. I don't want to track any of the stats or anything like that. I just want to be able to load up new routes and reference them as needed without much interference. Maybe I can leave my phone in the bag more too. 

The main options seem to be Wahoo or Garmin. There's also some smaller ones like the Beeline velo. The one that seems to be the best fit for me is the Wahoo Bolt. 

### Bike Routes

I looked at some routes on [Urbandirt boston](https://www.urbandirt.org/hubs/boston) which I forgot about. 

* [This one](https://www.urbandirt.org/routes/forest-hopping) looks cool as an alternate way back from Concord. 
* [This one](https://www.urbandirt.org/routes/multi-meadow) also has a path back from Lexington through Belmont. 
* I need to try some [stuff like this](https://www.urbandirt.org/routes/light-northern-dirt) up through Middlesex fells.
