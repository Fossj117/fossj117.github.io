Notes on [*District 9*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_9):  
* **Director**: Peter Jackson
* **Watch date**: 11/24/25
* **Rating**: 6.5/10  

**Notes**: 

* I thought this was okay; I was into it more at the beginning -- the premise is an interesting twist on this kind of first encounter movie, and has some interesting sorts of "realism" about how the world works.
* It's kind of odd tonally. It has like some serious themes and is shot like "documentary" style, but then also is kind of lighthearted/goofy at times? Main character is like "performing" for the documentary. On reflection I didn't really notice when it shifts out of that explicitly. Like who/where is the camera in this world when they are in the big action sequences etc? There's some notion that the camera is always "there" -- e.g. blood splatters on lens, but characters relation to it seems to slide in different ways. I did like the cuts in from academic experts. An interesting way to tell the story with some epistemic uncertainty; e.g. "this is the last known image of X" etc. 
* Some plot holes that I didn't really understand how to reconcile. E.g. if all the alien weapons are so powerful and can only be operated by aliens, why are they so disempowered? Can't they fight back with their super powerful weapons? If the humans have all this control over the aliens, why are they not able to use them to control the weapons?
