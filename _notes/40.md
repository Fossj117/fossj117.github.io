**Notes** (very quick): 

I am a big fan of this movie, and enjoyed it a lot on a second watch. It's one of my favorites of the past few years. Could write a bunch about what I like about it (and maybe will someday), but some rough notes for now. 

* A story with "drama" and narrative on the scale of real life. Portrayal of the rhythm, change and sameness of real life. Character with history and difficulty/pain; but narrative that is not built around that, it's just part of life -- personality and life builds up around past difficulty, not everything is "resolved". 
* Attention, maintenance, care as important themes -- the work of making the world nice to be in. Groundedness vs. ambition / wanting more. 
* Change and transience, sameness & difference; relation to beauty. Appreciation of little things; the real things of life. 
* Boundaries and attitudes from the world -- minor disrespects (e.g. mother & child scene) vs. real threats to peace (double shift).
* Loneliness vs. solitude. 
* I like the portrayal of sleep and dreaming in this film.
