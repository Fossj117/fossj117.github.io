Notes on [*Fargo*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fargo_(1996_film)):  
* **Director**: Joel Coen
* **Cinematographer**: Roger Deakins
* **Watch date**: 1/27/25  
* **Rating**: 8.4/10  

**Notes** (very quick): 

* Dark humor 
* Flat characters; not a ton of contextualization -- e.g. why does husband need the money in the first place? Violence doesn't feel overly "high stakes" even though it's very serious. 
* A lot of nice static shots where characters move around frame. E.g. car parking lot from above. 
* I like the shot where Marge is going out to car from breakfast and we see both inside and outside of the house. 
* Stark juxtaposition of midwestern "nice" vibe vs. violence/murder.
* The setting / environment is very present in the film. White/snowy, empty landscape.
* Liked scoring.
