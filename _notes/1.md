[Audrey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audrey_Tang) talks about the idea of being a "good enough" ancestor. 

This is not just an assertion of satisficing over perfectionism (or something similar). 

It's a step further: Audrey suggests that we should explicitly to avoid designing "perfect" or "too good" systems, which are not amenable to further revision. 

It's not just *okay*, but actually *desirable* to have a "crack" or "gap" in everything. These cracks let the light in, and leave space for future generations to revise and adapt what we have made.
