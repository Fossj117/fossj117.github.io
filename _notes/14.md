Some reflection questions: 

1. Am I aware of what I am spending my time on? 
2. How *am* I spending my time? 
3. How much time am I spending on things I *don't* think I should be spending time on? 
4. How much time am I spending *avoiding* or *not doing* things I *do* think I should be spending time on? 
5. How much of what I spend time on is directed by internal vs. external choices? 
6. How intentional am I being about what I spend time on?
